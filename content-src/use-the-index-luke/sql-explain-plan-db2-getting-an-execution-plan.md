title: "Getting an Execution Plan"
lang: en
---

Getting an execution plan from Db2 (LUW) is a three step procedure where the first step is a one-time setup.

## Create required tables (once)

The recommended way to create the required explain tables is to call this procedure:

```
CALL SYSPROC.SYSINSTALLOBJECTS('EXPLAIN', 'C', 
CAST (NULL AS VARCHAR(128)), CAST (NULL AS VARCHAR(128)))
```

This will install the required tables in the `SYSTOOLS` schema (e.g. `SYSTOOLS.EXPLAIN_STREAM`).

Alternative installation procedures and customizations are explained in the [documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5.x?topic=sql-explain-tables).

## Explain the statement

Prefix any SQL statement with `explain plan for` to store the execution plan details in the explain tables.

This step does not yet show the execution plan, it just stores it in the database.

```
EXPLAIN PLAN FOR SELECT 1 FROM sysibm.sysdummy1
```

## Display the stored execution plan

IBM provides some [tools to display the data stored in the explain tables](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5.x?topic=facility-tools-collecting-analyzing-explain-information). However, the output format is not as useful as it could be, so I’m using my own SQL query to display the information I’m usually interested in. The Db2 documentation actually recommends doing this.

Below you find the definition of the view `last_explained` which returns a formatted explain plan for the last statement that was explained for the current user in this database. Please note that it’s scope is not limited to the current session. The view can be used as simple as that:

```sql
SELECT * FROM last_explained
```

The result might look like this. The [next section](/sql/explain-plan/db2/operations) has the details how to interpret it.

#### Warning

This view is highly experimental. It is provided as is without any warranty. It was extended by Ember Crooks to include ActualRows if available. Read [her article](https://datageek.blog/2014/11/18/db2-explain-output-similar-to-other-rdbmses/) to see how to collect them.

The view assumes the explain tables in the `SYSTOOLS` schema. If you are using a different schema, you need to adjust the below view manually.

Minimum requirement: Db2 (LUW) 9.7 FixPack 4

#### Tip

The view is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fatalmind/DB2-last-explained) ([direct download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fatalmind/DB2-last-explained/master/last_explained.sql)).

TODO:

- Operator ID is currently giving the physical operator ID as stored in the explain tables. It might be more appropriate to display a line number like the Oracle DBMS_XPLAN does so that it is more easy to find a specific ID.
- Indicate the presences of predicates with a asterisk next to the operation ID like Oracle’s DBMS_PLAN does it.It might also be good to indicate the presences of filter predicates by using another character (e.g. !).Even more sophisticated features would be possible:*START and STOP predicates are present>A START but no STOP predicate is present<A STOP bu no START predicate is present!A SARG predicate is present (additionally, !).
- A heuristic to indicate Top-N clauses: if the number of rows drops for TBSCAN or IXSCAN but there are no predicates, it must be a Top-N limit. This logic is incomplete, of course.
