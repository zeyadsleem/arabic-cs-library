title: "Primary Keys"
lang: en

We start with the simplest yet most common `where` clause: the primary key lookup. For the examples throughout this chapter we use the `EMPLOYEES` table defined as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
   employee_id   NUMBER        NOT NULL,
   first_name    VARCHAR(1000) NOT NULL,
   last_name     VARCHAR(1000) NOT NULL,
   date_of_birth DATE          NOT NULL,
   phone_number  VARCHAR(1000) NOT NULL,
   CONSTRAINT employees_pk PRIMARY KEY (employee_id)
)
```

The database automatically creates an index for the primary key. That means there is an index on the `EMPLOYEE_ID` column, even though there is no `create index` statement.

#### Tip

[Appendix C*Example Schema*](/sql/example-schema) contains scripts to populate the `EMPLOYEES` table with sample data. You can use it to test the examples in your own environment.

To follow the text, it is enough to know that the table contains 1000 rows.

The following query uses the primary key to retrieve an employee’s name:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
  FROM employees
 WHERE employee_id = 123
```

The `where` clause cannot match multiple rows because the primary key constraint ensures uniqueness of the `EMPLOYEE_ID` values. The database does not need to follow the index leaf nodes—it is enough to traverse the index tree. We can use the so-called *execution plan* for verification:

Db2 (LUW)

The following execution plan was gathered with the [`last_explained` view](/sql/explain-plan/db2/getting-an-execution-plan#apa-db2-last_explained) available from the [appendix](/sql/explain-plan/db2/getting-an-execution-plan#apa-db2-last_explained).

```
Explain Plan
-------------------------------------------------------
ID | Operation             |                Rows | Cost
 1 | RETURN                |                     |   13
 2 |  FETCH EMPLOYEES      |    1 of 1 (100.00%) |   13
 3 |   IXSCAN EMPLOYEES_PK | 1 of 1000 (   .10%) |    6

Predicate Information
 3 - START (Q1.EMPLOYEE_ID = +00123.)
      STOP (Q1.EMPLOYEE_ID = +00123.)
```

The Operation `IXSCAN` is similar to Oracle’s `INDEX [RANGE|UNIQUE] SCAN`. From this output, we cannot decided if it is a unique or range scan. The `FETCH` operation corresponds to Oracle’s `TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX ROWID`.

MySQL

```javascript
+----+-----------+-------+---------+---------+------+-------+
| id | table     | type  | key     | key_len | rows | Extra |
+----+-----------+-------+---------+---------+------+-------+
|  1 | employees | const | PRIMARY | 5       |    1 |       |
+----+-----------+-------+---------+---------+------+-------+
```

Type `const` is MySQL’s equivalent of Oracle’s `INDEX UNIQUE SCAN`.

Oracle

```
---------------------------------------------------------------
|Id |Operation                   | Name         | Rows | Cost |
---------------------------------------------------------------
| 0 |SELECT STATEMENT            |              |    1 |    2 |
| 1 | TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX ROWID| EMPLOYEES    |    1 |    2 |
|*2 |  INDEX UNIQUE SCAN         | EMPLOYEES_PK |    1 |    1 |
---------------------------------------------------------------

Predicate Information (identified by operation id):
---------------------------------------------------
   2 - access("EMPLOYEE_ID"=123)
```

PostgreSQL

```
                QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using employees_pk on employees 
   (cost=0.00..8.27 rows=1 width=14)
   Index Cond: (employee_id = 123::numeric)
```

The PostgreSQL operation `Index Scan` combines the `INDEX [UNIQUE/RANGE] SCAN` and `TABLE ACCES BY INDEX ROWID` operations from the Oracle Database. It is not visible from the execution plan if the index access might potentially return more than one row.

SQL Server

```
|--Nested Loops(Inner Join)
   |--Index Seek(OBJECT:employees_pk,
   |               SEEK:employees.employee_id=@1
   |            ORDERED FORWARD)
   |--RID Lookup(OBJECT:employees,
                   SEEK:Bmk1000=Bmk1000
                 LOOKUP ORDERED FORWARD)
```

The SQL Server operation `INDEX SEEK` and `RID Lookup` correspond to Oracle’s `INDEX RANGE SCAN` and `TABLE ACCESS BY ROWID` respectively. Unlike the Oracle Database, SQL Server explicitly shows the `Nested Loops` join to combine the index and table data.

The Oracle execution plan shows an `INDEX UNIQUE SCAN`—the operation that only traverses the index tree. It fully utilizes the logarithmic scalability of the index to find the entry very quickly—almost independent of the table size.

#### Tip

The *execution plan* (sometimes *explain plan* or *query plan*) shows the steps the database takes to execute an SQL statement. [Appendix A](/sql/explain-plan) explains how to retrieve and read execution plans with other databases.

After accessing the index, the database must do one more step to fetch the queried data (`FIRST_NAME`, `LAST_NAME`) from the table storage: the `TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX ROWID` operation. This operation can become a performance bottleneck—as explained in [“*Slow Indexes, Part I*”](/sql/anatomy/slow-indexes)—but there is no such risk in connection with an `INDEX UNIQUE SCAN`. This operation cannot deliver more than one entry so it cannot trigger more than one table access. That means that the ingredients of a slow query are not present with an `INDEX UNIQUE SCAN`.

## Primary Keys without Unique Index

A primary key does not necessarily need a unique index—you can use a non-unique index as well. In that case the Oracle database does not use an `INDEX UNIQUE SCAN` but instead the `INDEX RANGE SCAN` operation. Nonetheless, the constraint still maintains the uniqueness of keys so that the index lookup delivers at most one entry.

One of the reasons for using non-unique indexes for a primary keys are *deferrable constraints*. As opposed to regular constraints, which are validated during statement execution, the database postpones the validation of deferrable constraints until the transaction is committed. Deferred constraints are required for inserting data into tables with circular dependencies.
