In the preceding chapter we looked at some reasons why network security is a never-ending challenge. As security is a negative goal, we can never be sure that we have foreseen and prevented every possible threat. Nevertheless, there are a number of general principles that have been developed over the decades that we can apply to improve the overall security of our networks and systems. We discuss these in this chapter and see them in action in subsequent chapters.

In order to take a systematic approach to security it helps to have a clear view of our requirements. Once we have defined those we can consider the principles that can be applied to help us meet them.

## 2.1 Security Requirements[](#security-requirements)

The first major requirement that comes to mind when thinking about sending data across a shared network is likely to be *confidentiality*. As noted in Chapter 1, there are many ways that an adversary might gain access to data in transit through a network. Confidentiality is the ability to prevent data from being read by anyone other than its intended recipient. This, for example, is what is required to prevent your credit card details being exposed when you enter then on a website.

Closely related to the confidentiality of data is *traffic confidentiality*. This is the idea that we don’t want an adversary to be able to determine where or to whom we are sending traffic, or in what quantity. This presents some distinct challenges from data confidentiality; there is no need for network devices to see our data, but they generally must look at packet headers, which contain destination information, to determine where to send traffic.

The second major requirement is *integrity*, which is about having confidence that the information we’re receiving is trustworthy, and for example, has not been modified by some adversary while in transit. Assuring integrity is multi-faceted, involving more than just “in transit” adversaries.

For example, we need to be able to verify that an item of data was sent by the entity that claimed to have sent it. This means we need to *authenticate* the sender. In the example of e-commerce, this is what allows us to know we are connected to, say, the website of the vendor we wish to patronize and not handing over our credit card to some impostor.

Authentication implies that we must have a concept of *identity*. That is, we need a system by which communicating entities, often called *principals*, can securely identify each other. This problem is harder to solve than it might first appear. How can we know that a website with a particular URL actually represents the business with whom we wish to communicate? Or how does a banking system know that the person behind a particular HTTP request is actually the account holder?

Integrity also requires messages be *fresh* and *timely*, which is threatened by the possibility data is captured and then retransmitted at some later time. This is known as a *replay attack*, where for example, we want to protect against an attacker repeatedly adding an item to a shopping cart. Thus, it is a common requirement to have some form of *replay prevention*.

The final major requirement is *availability*, which is simply the ability to access all the data we have the right to access. System failures, either benign or caused by malicious actors, restrict availability. Another common threat to availability is *denial-of-service* (DoS) attacks. The Morris Worm was an early example of an unintentional DoS attack: as the worm spread to more and more computers, and reinfected computers on which it was already present, the resources consumed by the worm rendered those computers unusable. Networks provide a means by which data can be amplified by replication, allowing large volumes of traffic to be sent to the target of a DoS attack; thus it has become necessary to develop means to mitigate such attacks.

As a consequence of these three main requirements—confidentiality, integrity, and availability—additional requirements are placed on the underlying systems we build upon, which brings us back to the idea of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) introduced in Chapter 1. We generally have three inter-related requirements for these platforms, beyond their not being malicious (which is implied by our including them in our TCB). The first we have already seen: they must provide a local (component-specific) notion of *identity*, giving us a way to support multiple principals (users). The second is they must provide *isolation*, protecting information belonging to one user from other users on the system. The third is they must enforce *access control*, limiting which users have access to what data, along with what operations they are allowed to perform on it. Providing these mechanisms gives us the foundation we need to then meet the confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements as we communicate over the Internet.

## 2.2 Broader System Requirements[](#broader-system-requirements)

Understanding the requirements of a secure system is important, but security is just one of many requirements placed on any system. It’s also important for systems to be reliable, available, scalable, performant, usable, manageable, evolvable, observable, and so on.

These system requirements are sometimes indistinguishable from security. For example, a retail system brought down by a security breach is just as unavailable as one brought down by a hardware failure or a software bug. Similarly, a video delivery system designed to scale up to handle a flash crowd may also able to scale to fend off a DoS attack. In practice, it can be difficult to pinpoint the root cause of a failure (was it malicious or benign) and the root source of workload (was it malicious or legitimate). The main difference is that it is generally possible to provision for legitimate workload and benign failures, which can be measured and predicted (although not always accurately), whereas malicious attacks are often less predictable (although they should be expected).

Where the broader set of requirements become interesting is when they are in conflict with each other, and tradeoffs become necessary. For example, making a system secure can add latency to every transaction. Similarly, keeping a system secure puts additional burden on users (making it less usable), with the flip side being that those users are often the weakest link in the security strategy. These tradeoffs do not need to force an either-or scenario—clearly, designing for both security and usability is desirable—but no requirement is absolute, or we’d simply secure a system by denying access to all users.

For our purposes, the main takeaway is that security is unique in that it is not just a requirement *for* a system, but it is often best viewed as a system in and of itself, one that must be usable, scalable, manageable, evolvable, observable, available, reliable, and so on.

## 2.3 Principles for Secure Systems[](#principles-for-secure-systems)

Given how long people have been trying to build secure computing systems, including networked systems, there has been plenty of time to develop some principles that improve the chances that the system remains secure. We outline some of the most well-known principles here and the following chapters contain examples of how those principles are applied in practice.

### 2.3.1 Defense in Depth[](#defense-in-depth)

As we have noted, one of the central challenges in security is that we never know if we have done enough. Much as we try to defend against all possible attacks, there is no way to be sure that we’ve thought of everything. This is what we mean by saying that security is a negative goal: we aim to be sure that a set of things cannot happen, but we can never quite be sure that all vulnerabilities have been found and mitigated. This leads to the idea of *defense in depth*: layer upon layer of defense, so that even if one layer is penetrated, there are multiple layers of defense still in place. Only by getting through *all* the layers of defense will an attacker be able to achieve their goal (of stealing our data, for example). The hope is that with enough layers of defense, the odds of an attacker penetrating all of them becomes vanishingly small.

As a simple example, a corporation might make use of a VPN (virtual private network) to ensure that only authorized users can access corporate servers, and that when they do so over the Internet, their traffic is encrypted. However, this single layer of defense is prone to several forms of attack, such as the presence of malware on the remote user’s computer, or compromise of the remote user’s credentials. Thus, additional layers of defense are needed, such as internal firewalls between different corporate systems; tools to detect, remediate, and prevent malware on the remote users’ systems; and multi-factor authentication to protect against compromised user credentials. This is just a short list of defensive measures that are commonly used, and would not on their own be considered sufficient. But the point to note here is the use of many overlapping layers of defense, with the aim being that, collectively, they raise the bar high enough to thwart the majority of attacks.

The fact that we read about breaches in which attackers succeed in gaining access to corporate systems and data on a regular basis might suggest that the battle is being lost. Certainly the challenges in defeating determined attackers are substantial. However, it is surprising how frequently it turns out that a well-publicized attack has succeeded because some relatively common defensive measure, such as multi-factor authentication, was not put in place correctly.

### 2.3.2 Principle of Least Privilege[](#principle-of-least-privilege)

The principle of least privilege has a long history in computer science, having been proposed by Saltzer and Schroeder in 1975 (see the Further Reading). The principle states:

> “Every program and every user of the system should operate using the least set of privileges necessary to complete the job.”

A common example of this principle in practice is to avoid running anything as root on Unix-like systems unless absolutely necessary.

In the context of networking, this principle implies that applications which access the network should only have access to the set of resources needed to do their jobs. The concept of zero trust, which has started to gain popularity as an approach to network security in recent years, follows closely the idea of least privilege. We return to this topic in a later chapter.

Interestingly, Saltzer and Schroeder explicitly mention “firewalls” in the section of their paper on least privilege, using the analogy from the physical world (a wall to prevent the spread of fire) before the concept of network firewalls had been invented. As we discuss later, it turns out that the widespread use of network firewalls for most of their history *failed* to follow the principle of least privilege, in that it is common to find large “zones” of a network where all machines have access to each other, even though this access is not actually required for the machines to do their jobs. Addressing this shortcoming required some innovations in the design of firewalls that arrived only in the last decade or so.

### 2.3.3 Open Design[](#open-design)

Another principle codified by Saltzer and Schroeder is that of open design. It states that the mechanisms and algorithms that are used to implement security should be open, not secret. The idea is that rather than trying to keep something as large and complex as an encryption algorithm secret, it is better for that algorithm to be published and only the key(s) be secret. There are two reasons for this principle:

- It is hard to keep an algorithm secret, especially if it is in widespread use as is the case with encryption on the Internet;
- Making security mechanisms robust against all forms of attack is, as we have discussed, difficult. Thus it is better to have wide scrutiny of these mechanisms to expose weaknesses that may then be rectified.

The history of computer security is filled with cautionary tales related to this principle. In the cases where the principle is followed, subtle bugs in protocol design or implementation have been exposed and patches rolled out to mitigate them. Heartbleed, a bug in the widely used open source implementation of SSL, is a famous example. The consequences of the bug were serious, with as many as half a million Web servers being impacted, but it was a positive thing that the bug was found, reported, and remediated quickly.

If this principle is not followed, a design that is believed to be secret may in fact have been compromised (e.g. by reverse engineering), or may have flaws that have gone unreported but are nevertheless being exploited.

Another way to state this principle is “minimize secrets”. For example, rather than trying to keep an entire algorithm secret, only keep secret the key that is used to decrypt with the algorithm. It is much easier to replace a key that has been compromised than to replace an entire algorithm.

### 2.3.4 Fail-Safe Defaults[](#fail-safe-defaults)

The idea behind this principle is the default settings of a system are the ones most likely to be used, so by default, undesired access should be disabled. It then takes an explicit action to enable access. This is a principle that dates back at least to 1965 according to the Saltzer and Schroeder paper.

It turns out that the design of the Internet really doesn’t follow this approach. The datagram delivery model of the Internet, by default, allows packets from anywhere to be sent anywhere. So to the extent that sending a packet to a system can be defined as accessing the system, the Internet’s default behavior does not provide fail-safe defaults. Efforts to revert to a more secure default behavior include such old ideas as network firewalls and virtual private networks, along with more modern approaches such as microsegmentation and zero trust architectures. We will discuss these developments in a later chapter.

### 2.3.5 Least Common Mechanism[](#least-common-mechanism)

This principle states that the amount of mechanism that is common to more than one user should be minimized. The principle was originally articulated by Gerald Popek in 1974, where in the context of operating system design, he argued in favor of minimizing the number of mechanisms put in the OS kernel. A failure (or security breach) of such a shared mechanism would impact all users, and so it is better to provide it in some other way, such as a library running the user’s address space. The failure of such a mechanism then negatively impacts only that user, and not all users.

The counter argument is that any mechanism that requires privileged access—e.g., accessing an I/O device or modifying a shared data structure—must be implemented in a common layer (i.e., the kernel), but even then, care should be taken to decompose the mechanism so as to minimize the sub-pieces that are common. Library OSes designed during the 1990s took this argument to its logical conclusion, reducing the “kernel” to its bare minimum, with most functionality one typically expects from an OS running as a library co-located with the application.[[1]](#id2)

In an OS setting, the principle of least common mechanism is related to the principle of least privilege since the common platform (kernel) runs with greater privilege. This is because minimizing the number of mechanisms that require elevated kernel privilege also minimizes the privilege required across all mechanisms that make up a system. In a network setting, the principle is related to the end-to-end-argument. That is, it is best to avoid putting functions such as encryption into the network when the user is likely to need end-to-end encryption anyway.

### 2.3.6 Design for Iteration[](#design-for-iteration)

Given what we have said about the difficulty of knowing that a system is secure, a useful design principle is to accept that we will need to iterate, and design for it. A good example of this is in the choice of particular cryptographic algorithms for integrity protection or encryption. These algorithms are often found to be insufficiently strong after some number of years, perhaps due to a weakness in the underlying mathematics, or breakthroughs in algorithms, or just the steady improvement in computing power that happens over time. Thus, any protocol that is developed that depends on such an algorithm should be designed such that a change of algorithm is an expected behavior. We see this in protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) which includes a set of procedures by which two participants negotiate the cryptographic algorithms to be used.

Recent developments in quantum computing have raised the issue that many existing forms of cryptographic algorithm may need to be replaced. While the timeframe in which such a change will be needed remains a subject of debate, the safe choice is to accept that cryptographic algorithms will periodically need to be replaced.

### 2.3.7 Audit Trails[](#audit-trails)

Part of dealing with the impossibility of covering all possible security threats is to accept that sometimes we need to analyze what has gone wrong. This leads to the idea that security needs to be auditable (observable). For example, it will be easier to conduct a post-mortem of a breach involving compromised login credentials if every login attempt is logged, along with information such as whether the login came over a VPN, what IP address was used, and so on. Similarly it is very hard to prevent insider attacks, but suitable logging might both make it easier to detect such attacks quickly and to deter those who might undertake them.

In a different vein, consider the design of secure protocols. The specification for TLS (transport layer security) describes a large number of error conditions that may trigger alerts, and recommends the logging of all such alerts. Such logging would help in understanding if the protocol was subject to an attack that involved incorrect or unexpected messages. Given the complexity of negotiations that go on in security protocols (to establish cryptographic algorithms and parameters, for example) it is wise to assume that these may have subtle bugs, and a good set of audit tools will enable any such bugs to be detected and then remedied.

Of course, the audit mechanisms themselves must be designed to be secure. A determined attacker will, in all likelihood, try to erase their tracks, so logging for audit purposes cannot just be an afterthought; it has to be part of the design of a secure system.

## 2.4 Best Practices[](#best-practices)

Design principles help guide how a system is architected to be secure, but an architecture has to be implemented by an engineering team and run on a day-to-day basis by an operations team. Mistakes in the implementation or operational practices render the best intentions impotent. To this end, software companies typically establish a set of best practices for the entire software lifecycle, from design to coding, deployment, and operation.

These practices start by establishing the security metrics that the end result is to be judged by, along with the processes used to review designs and test compliance. On the development side, emphasis is placed on using cryptography standards and the best available protocols, platforms, and languages. It is **not** an engineer’s job to reinvent the security mechanisms described in this book, but rather, to know what mechanisms are available and how to use them. Once a system is deployed and operational, the emphasis is on proactively monitoring the system for anomalous behavior and establishing an incident response plan to deal with suspected attacks. Continuously collecting data about a running system is commonplace, and using AI/ML to detect (and potentially respond to) attacks is becoming increasingly common.

The details of these procedures is beyond the scope of this book, except as we note, that they depend on engineers and operators being well-informed about available security mechanisms. For an example of industry practices, we recommend Microsoft’s Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) practices.

## 2.5 Summary[](#summary)

Just as we can never be quite sure that we have covered all possible vectors of attack against a system, there is no hard limit to the set of principles that can be applied to developing secure systems. The principles covered above include several that were drawn from the influential paper by Saltzer and Schroeder from 1975. That is the same Saltzer whose book (with Kaashoek) we referred to in Chapter 1. The fact that many of the principles from the 1975 paper reappear in the 2009 book is probably a sign that Saltzer had some confidence that these principles have stood the test of time. We recommend reading the entire paper.
