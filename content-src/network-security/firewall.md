Whereas much of this book has focused on the uses of cryptography to provide such security features as authentication and confidentiality, there is a whole set of security issues that are not readily addressed by cryptographic means. For example, worms, viruses and other malware spread by exploiting bugs in operating systems and application programs (and sometimes human gullibility as well); no amount of cryptography can help you if your machine has unpatched vulnerabilities. So other approaches are often used to keep out various forms of potentially harmful traffic. Firewalls are one of the most common ways to do this.

To provide a little more context for this chapter, it is helpful to understand that writing software that is not vulnerable to being hacked is an important part of the overall security landscape. It is also a broad topic, starting with questions about the programming language you use (e.g., memory-safe languages like Rust are less susceptible than, say, C), and also including a variety of OS problems (e.g., how to efficiently enforce isolation between processes). Such topics are outside the scope of this book, where we instead take a network-centric view, and ask: *“What can we do in the network to either minimize opportunities for malware to exploit vulnerable software, or to mitigate the impact when such exploits succeed.”* Firewalls, and more generally *security appliances*, are part of the answer. They are devices placed at strategic points throughout the network that identify and respond to malicious traffic.

The other big-picture takeaway is that firewalls and other security appliances illustrate the principle of defense in depth introduced in Chapter 2. It would be ideal for all the software we run to be bullet-proof, but for those times it isn’t—e.g., when a new bug is discovered—we need a second line of defense. Network appliances play that role.

## 9.1 Basic Principles of Firewalls[](#basic-principles-of-firewalls)

The historical meaning of a firewall is a barrier to prevent the spread of fire from one part of a building to another. Firewalls are also present in many automotive vehicles to separate passengers from the noisy (and possibly fire-prone) engine compartment. Saltzer and Schroeder in 1975 applied the term, possibly for the first time in the context of computer security, when discussing least privilege.

A network firewall is a system that typically sits between two regions of a network, as illustrated in [Figure 33](#fig-firewall), protecting the flow of traffic from one region to another. A common location would be a strategic point such as the ingress/egress point to an enterprise network or data center. Of course, unlike a physical firewall that blocks everything in its path, a network firewall is really a sort of packet filter that makes decisions about exactly what traffic is allowed to pass through it.

Historically, a firewall has been implemented as an “appliance”: a dedicated system with one job, filtering packets. Firewalls have also been provided as a set of features available on a router, and a “personal firewall” may be implemented on an end-user machine. More recently (in the last decade or so), *distributed firewalls* have appeared in an effort to apply security policies to a greater amount of traffic. We return to this class of firewall later in the chapter.

Firewall-based security depends on the firewall being at some sort of choke-point. There should be no way to bypass the firewall via other gateways, or alternate paths such as wireless connections or dial-up connections. While the job of a firewall is to block potentially harmful traffic (“fire”) for some definition of “harmful”, a great deal of traffic passes through a firewall. One common setting for a firewall is “default closed”: by default it blocks traffic unless that traffic is specifically allowed to pass through. For example, it might filter out all incoming messages except those addressed to a particular set of IP addresses and to particular TCP port numbers. Given the complexity of the environments where firewalls are used, with perhaps thousands of IP addresses and hundreds of applications in use, the configuration of firewalls also often becomes complex.

[![_images/f08-20-9780123850591.png](/images/network-security/firewall-0-f08-20-9780123850591.webp)](_images/f08-20-9780123850591.png)

Figure 33. A firewall filters packets flowing between a site and the rest of the Internet.[](#id1)

When deployed at an ingress/egress point, a firewall divides a network into a more-trusted zone on one side of the firewall (the “inside”) and a less-trusted zone that is “external” to the firewall. This is useful if, for example, you do not want external users to access a particular host or service within your site. Much of the complexity comes from the fact that you want to allow different kinds of access to different external users, ranging from the general public, to business partners, to remotely located members of your organization. A firewall may also impose restrictions on outgoing traffic to prevent certain attacks and to limit losses if an adversary succeeds in getting access inside the firewall (or to limit the damage of insider attacks).

The location of a firewall often happens to also be the dividing line between globally addressable regions and those that use local addresses. Hence, Network Address Translation (NAT) functionality and firewall functionality often are found in the same device, even though they are logically separate.

While the example above suggests a trusted and an untrusted network, firewalls are often used to create multiple *zones of trust*, such as a hierarchy of increasingly trusted zones. A common arrangement involves three zones of trust: the internal network, the *DMZ* (“demilitarized zone”); and the rest of the Internet. The DMZ is used to hold services such as DNS and email servers that need to be accessible to the outside. Both the internal network and the outside world can access the DMZ, but hosts in the DMZ cannot access the internal network; therefore, an adversary who succeeds in compromising a host in the exposed DMZ still cannot access the internal network. The DMZ can be periodically restored to a clean state.

Firewalls filter traffic based on information that can be found in the packets passing through them. This is likely to include such fields as IP addresses, the TCP or UDP port numbers, and so on. They are configured with a table of values in these fields that characterize the packets they will, and will not, forward. Generally, each entry in the table is a 4-tuple or 5-tuple: It gives the IP address and TCP (or UDP) port number for both the source and destination (four fields), and it may also include the specific value of the layer 4 protocol (TCP, UDP, etc.).

For example, a firewall might be configured to filter out (not forward) all packets that match the following description:

```
   (198.51.100.14, 1234, 192.0.2.11, 80, TCP)
```

This pattern says to discard all TCP packets from port 1234 on host 198.51.100.14 addressed to port 80 on host 192.0.2.11. (Port 80 is the well-known TCP port for HTTP.) Of course, it’s often not practical to name every source host whose packets you want to filter, so the patterns can include wildcards. For example,

```
   (*,  *, 192.0.2.11, 80, TCP)
```

says to filter out all packets addressed to port 80 on 192.0.2.11, regardless of what source host or port sent the packet. Notice that address patterns like these require the firewall to make forwarding/filtering decisions based on level 4 port numbers, in addition to level 3 host addresses. For this reason, network layer firewalls are sometimes called *level 4 switches*.

Linux has a firewall feature called `ufw` (uncomplicated firewall) that can apply firewall rules on a host. We can implement the policy described above with the following command:

```bash
    $ sudo ufw deny to 192.0.2.11 port 80
    rule added
    $
```

Then we can check that our rule was applied correctly:

```bash
    $ sudo ufw status
    Status: active

    To                         Action      From
    --                         ------      ----
    192.0.2.11 80              DENY        Anywhere

    $
```

In the preceding discussion, the firewall forwards everything except where specifically instructed to filter out certain kinds of packets. A firewall could also filter out everything unless explicitly instructed to forward it, or use a mix of the two strategies. For example, instead of blocking access to port 80 on host 192.0.2.11, the firewall might be instructed to block everything except access to port 25 (the SMTP mail port) on a particular mail server, such as

```
   (*,  *, 198.51.100.9, 25)
```

We can specify this behavior with ufw:

```bash
    $ sudo ufw default deny incoming
    Default incoming policy changed to 'deny'
    (be sure to update your rules accordingly)
    $ sudo ufw allow to 198.51.100.9 port 25
    rule added
    $ sudo ufw status
    Status: active

    To                         Action      From
    --                         ------      ----
    198.51.100.9 25            ALLOW       Anywhere
```

Experience has shown that firewalls are very frequently configured incorrectly, allowing unsafe access, or breaking applications that need access. Part of the problem is that filtering rules can overlap in complex ways, making it hard for a system administrator to correctly express the intended filtering. A design principle that we discussed in Chapter 2 comes into play here: fail-safe defaults. The application of that principle to firewalls says they should, by default, discard all packets other than those that are explicitly allowed. Of course, this means that some valid applications might be accidentally disabled; the typical approach is that users of those applications eventually notice the breakage and ask the system administrator to make the appropriate change.

Many client/server applications dynamically assign a port to the client. If a client inside a firewall initiates access to an external server, the server’s response would be addressed to the dynamically assigned port. This poses a problem: how can a firewall be configured to allow an arbitrary server’s response packet but disallow a similar packet for which there was no client request? This is not possible with a *stateless firewall*, which evaluates each packet in isolation. It requires a *stateful firewall*, which keeps track of the state of each connection. An incoming packet addressed to a dynamically assigned port would then be allowed only if it is a valid response in the current state of a connection on that port.

Modern firewalls also understand and filter based on many specific application-level protocols such as HTTP or FTP. They use information specific to that protocol, such as URLs in the case of HTTP, to decide whether to discard a message. When firewalls are able to inspect payloads that are inside the TCP header (for example, to parse an HTTP request), this is referred to as *deep packet inspection* (DPI). Of course, DPI can be a challenge if end-to-end encryption is used.

A particular type of firewall that can interpret application traffic is the *Web Application Firewall*. Such firewalls are often placed directly in front of servers delivering web applications (or are implemented as a module within the server). They inspect the application traffic and apply filtering rules to identify and block specific attacks that target known vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection. When TLS is in use (as it invariably is in the modern web), web application firewalls terminate the HTTPS connection so that the application payload can be inspected. The open source ModSecurity project is a widely-used example of a web application firewall.

## 9.2 Strengths and Weaknesses of Firewalls[](#strengths-and-weaknesses-of-firewalls)

At best, a firewall protects a network from undesired access from the rest of the Internet; it cannot provide security to legitimate communication between the inside and the outside of the firewall. In contrast, the cryptography-based security mechanisms described in this chapter are capable of providing secure communication between any participants anywhere. This being the case, why are firewalls so common? One reason is that firewalls can be deployed unilaterally (by a network administrator, for example), using individual commercial products, while cryptography-based security requires support at both endpoints of the communication. A more fundamental reason for the dominance of firewalls is that they encapsulate security in a centralized place, in effect factoring security out of the rest of the network. A system administrator can manage the firewall to provide security, freeing the users and applications inside the firewall from security concerns—at least some kinds of security concerns. And as noted at the start of the chapter, encryption and authentication offer limited protection against exploitation of bugs in the operating systems of hosts.

Unfortunately, firewalls have serious limitations. Since a firewall does not restrict communication between hosts that are on the same side of the firewall, the adversary who does manage to gain access to one host at a site potentially has access to all local hosts. How might an adversary gain access inside the firewall? The adversary could be a disgruntled employee with legitimate access, or the adversary’s software could be hidden in some software installed from a USB drive or downloaded from the Web. It might be possible to bypass the firewall by using a VPN—this has proven to be a common form of attack in recent years.

A related problem is that any parties granted access through your firewall, such as business partners or externally located employees, become a security vulnerability. If their security is not as good as yours, then an adversary could penetrate your security by penetrating their security.

While part of the motivation for firewalls is to protect machines that may have vulnerabilities from attack, their ability to do so is limited. If, for example, an attacker is able to gain access to a machine inside the firewall via one of the methods mentioned above, they may then be able to connect to another machine inside the firewall that contains an unpatched vulnerability, even though that machine itself is not directly accessible through the firewall. System administrators are expected to monitor for new vulnerabilities and patch them, but there is always a chance the vulnerabilities appear faster than then can be remediated. While staying up to date with patches is a best practice, it is certainly not one that is followed uniformly.

In Chapter 1 we discussed the threat posed by viruses, worms, and the general category of malware. While firewalls aim to stop the spread of malware, it can be a difficult task, since many operations that the firewall needs to permit, such as web browsing or email delivery, can also be used for the delivery of malware.

One approach that is used to detect malware is to search for segments of code from known malware, sometimes called a *signature*. This approach has its own challenges, as cleverly designed malware can tweak its representation in various ways. There is also a potential impact on network performance to perform such detailed inspection of data entering a network.

Some of the limitations of firewalls are related to the assumption that all traffic has to be funneled through a single appliance (or a small number of them). This leads to challenges both in performance, since so much traffic passes through a single choke point, and in effectiveness, since there can be plenty of traffic within an enterprise or a data center that has no need to pass through such a choke point. These limitations have led to the development of *distributed firewalls*, which we discuss in the following section.

## 9.3 Distributed Firewalls[](#distributed-firewalls)

A conventional firewall is implemented as a *choke point:* the network is set up in such a way that traffic must pass through the firewall to get from one part of the network to another. It is common to talk about devices as being “inside” or “outside” the firewall based on which side of that choke point they sit on. There are two implications of such an approach. One is that any devices that sit on the same side of the firewall are free to communicate with each other uninterrupted by the firewall. The second is that there must be an impenetrable barrier around the devices that are “inside” the firewall, with the firewall being the only way to get through that barrier. This seems appealing if you are trying to secure, say, the machines inside a single building, with only one connection to the outside world, but it becomes a lot less attractive if we are talking about securing all the machines in a complex enterprise spread across many sites. Even in simple cases, people find ways around a firewall. Once upon a time you might have to worry about an unsanctioned dial-up connection bypassing a firewall, while wireless networks and users at the ends of VPN tunnels are a bigger issue in contemporary settings. In any case, the concept of an impenetrable perimeter can be very difficult to sustain in practice.

The fact that a perimeter firewall does not filter traffic between machines on the same side of the firewall has enabled a set of attacks that make use of *lateral movement*. The core idea is that an attacker obtains a foothold in one system *inside* the firewall and then uses that as a base of operations to move around to the ultimate target. The initial system that the attacker breaches may not be particularly important. Perhaps he gains access via a phishing attack or by leveraging a vulnerability in the OS. But at this point the firewall is of no use, and the attacker can start trying to find ways to move from one system to another inside the firewall, until eventually he has access to a machine of interest, such as one holding sensitive data. These types of lateral movement attacks are extremely common and have been well documented, often lasting for months before they are detected.

The obvious solution to problems of lateral movement would seem to be internal firewalls. However, such a solution raises a new set of challenges. Consider the example in [Figure 34](#fig-dc-firewall), in which a single firewall has been deployed to filter traffic flows among a set of virtual machines in a datacenter.

Suppose that traffic sent from VM A to VM C needs to be processed at the firewall. To ensure it is filtered, traffic needs to be routed over a path that traverses the firewall, not necessarily the shortest path from A to C. In the more extreme case of traffic from VM A to VM B, the two VMs sit on the same host, so the traffic from A to B needs to be sent out of the host, across the network to the firewall, and then back to B. This is clearly not efficient, and consumes resources both within the network and at the network interface for the hairpinned traffic. Furthermore, the firewall itself has the potential to become a bottleneck, as all traffic requiring filtering must pass through to that centralized device.

Finally, there is considerable management overhead in supporting such an internal firewall. Assume that we start with some sensible default policies that deny all traffic flows aside from those explicitly allowed. Each new application that is deployed will require some new firewall rule to be created to allow traffic to flow between the component machines for that application. If a VM is moved, we may need to update the routing and the firewall rules to ensure that traffic continues to be filtered correctly. All of these concerns have led to internal firewalls being used rather sparingly.

[![_images/single-firewall.png](/images/network-security/firewall-1-single-firewall.webp)](_images/single-firewall.png)

Figure 34. A single firewall in a virtualized datacenter.[](#id2)

The solution to the many issues with internal firewalls appeared as one of the features of network virtualization, the distributed firewall. [Figure 35](#fig-dist-firewall) illustrates a distributed firewall implementation. In this case, traffic sent from VM A to VM C can be processed by a firewall function at either (or both) of the virtual switches that it traverses, and still be sent over the shortest path through the network underlay between the two hosts, without hairpinning to a centralized firewall. Furthermore, traffic from VM A to VM B need never even leave the host on which those two VMs reside, passing only through the virtual switch on that host to receive the necessary firewall treatment.

A significant side effect of distributing a service in this way is that there is no longer a central bottleneck. Every time another server is added to host some more VMs, there is a new virtual switch with capacity to do some amount of distributed processing. This means it is relatively simple to scale out the amount of firewalling in this way.

[![_images/distributed-firewall.png](/images/network-security/firewall-2-distributed-firewall.webp)](_images/distributed-firewall.png)

Figure 35. A distributed firewall is implemented as part of the virtual switch in every host in a datacenter.[](#id3)

A detail that we have glossed over up to this point is that the distributed firewall needs to be configured somehow. It would be intractable to configure firewall policies in every single virtual switch throughout a data center. This is why distributed firewalls appeared as a feature of software-defined networks. The SDN controller provides a central point of administrative control for firewall policies, while the implementation of filtering rules is distributed out to the virtual switches. Thus, for example, a rule that specifies how traffic from VM A to VM B should be filtered can be expressed to the SDN controller, which then calculates how to create the low level filtering rules to push out to the appropriate virtual switches. The SDN controller can also take account of such events as the migration of a VM from one location to another, or the addition of a new VM that requires additional firewall rules to be installed.

The approach described above is often referred to as *micro-segmentation*. By contrast to traditional firewall approaches in which large network segments offer unfettered access among all devices on the segment, micro-segmentation creates small and precisely defined virtual networks that connect only those systems that need to be able to communicate to deliver a particular service or function.

For further details on network virtualization and distributed services we recommend our companion book on software-defined networks.

## 9.4 Zero Trust Security[](#zero-trust-security)

As we noted above, traditional firewalls suffer from a fundamental weakness: they attempt to divide the network into “trusted” and “untrusted” zones. If an attacker manages to find a way to get access within the trusted zone, perhaps by compromising a legitimate piece of software running on the trusted side of the firewall, they now have a large set of machines on which to launch further attacks without interference. This state of affairs runs counter to some of the security principles we outlined in Chapter 2, notably the principle of least privilege. A machine on the trusted side of a firewall often has access to a lot more resources—other machines and data—than is necessary to do its job. One of the main approaches to improve this state of affairs is known as “zero trust security”.

The term “zero trust” has been in use for decades, but started to enter widespread use around 2009, helped by the analyst firm Forrester. The central idea behind zero trust is that, by default, every device and user should be untrusted. Each user and device then needs to authenticate itself to gain access to a precise set of services. There is no blanket “trust this device to access anything” policy. Zero trust stands in contrast to the old “perimeter security” model in which there is the idea of a trusted region within a perimeter protected by firewalls and an untrusted region outside the perimeter.

Zero trust is sufficiently well accepted that NIST has written a specification (see Further Reading below) which provides this helpful definition:

> *“Zero trust…became the term used to describe various cybersecurity solutions that moved security away from implied trust based on network location and instead focused on evaluating trust on a per-transaction basis.”*

The classic example of trust based on location would be sitting in an office connected to some corporate network. Such a network would, in the past, have allowed anyone connected to it to access to a wide set of servers and data, with the trust being assumed because the user had managed to get admitted to the building.

There is more to zero trust that just getting away from location-based access. As a motivating example, consider a traditional VPN server providing remote access to a corporate network. Once a remote user is authenticated to the server, they are given access to a broad set of “inside the perimeter” resources (machines, data, etc.) within the enterprise. In effect, the user and their device are now treated as “trusted” to access many different systems. Such an approach has been the cause of many published breaches of sensitive data. An infamous example involved a heating and cooling system contractor’s VPN credentials being used to access a retailer’s database of customer credit card data. By contrast, a zero trust approach would entail a precisely defined policy that authenticates the user and their device to only the systems that are needed for them to do their job.

Micro-segmentation, described above, was one of the early technologies created to help in the implementation of zero trust. Rather than allowing all machines in a large network segment to communicate freely, as was the case previously, micro-segmentation allows precisely defined policies to limit communication among a set of devices to just what is needed to deliver their intended function. For example, the systems related to heating and cooling don’t need access to the systems where customer credit card details are stored. A default policy of no access can also be established, with explicit configuration then required to create precisely specified allowable communication patterns between specific devices.

The VPN example above provides motivation for a different approach to handling users and devices outside of the confines of a traditional office and outside the perimeter defenses. A well-known and comprehensive approach to rethinking the perimeter defense and VPN model is Google’s BeyondCorp, described in a 2014 paper in the further reading section below. It is both an approach used to implement zero trust at Google for employees accessing corporate resources and a service that enterprises can implement themselves.

The starting position for BeyondCorp is that the perimeter model no longer makes sense in a world of global connectivity, remote workers, and ubiquitous mobile devices. The name suggests moving “beyond corporate”—that is, moving away from the idea that there is a trusted corporate network inside a perimeter and than any user or device inside that perimeter should have access to everything on the corporate network. Instead, users and devices have to be authenticated and authorized to receive fine-grained access to specific resources, no matter what their location is.

A central aspect of BeyondCorp is that only “managed devices” get to access protected resources. These managed devices are all issued with their own certificates so that they can be authenticated. Before connecting to any service within the enterprise, the device connects to a proxy that can perform authentication. After a device has been authenticated, then the user also has to authenticate themselves using two-factor authentication, and the user’s access privileges are looked up in a database. Thus, for example, engineers may have access rights to engineering systems such as code repositories, but not to finance or HR systems. Only after all these checks—device, user authentication, and user authorization—have passed does the connection get established between the client and the server. Device checks may include not only verifying the certificate on a device but also checking that its operating system is up to date or that it has relevant antivirus software installed.

There are quite a few subtleties to BeyondCorp (and there are publications describing its deployment) but the core principal of zero trust that it embodies is this: location inside a perimeter (or building) is not a reason for a device or user to be trusted to access a broad set of resources. Nor should a VPN tunnel grant access to a all the resources within the perimeter. Only after the device and the user have been authenticated and authorization has been checked can the user access a specific resource. So another way to say “zero trust” might be “narrow and specific trust after authentication and authorization” although it’s less memorable.

## 9.5 Intrusion Detection and Prevention[](#intrusion-detection-and-prevention)

As introduced at the beginning of this chapter, *security appliances* are a generalization of firewalls. Such appliances are placed throughout the network, watching for and responding to unwanted traffic. The main challenge they face is how to distinguish between good and bad traffic. This section looks at two examples: an *intrusion detection systems* (IDS), and its sibling *intrusion prevention systems* (IPS).

These systems look for anomalous activity, such as an unusually large amount of traffic targeting a particular port number, which often signals a malicious attempt to probe for a vulnerability. When identified, the appliance either generates an alarm for network managers, or in some cases, is able to take immediate action to limit the damage.

A good example of an IPS is Snort, an open source project first published in 1999, having started life as an IDS, and now owned by Cisco. In its original incarnation, Snort provided a lightweight, rule-based packet filtering and capture tool based on Berkeley Packet Filters. The idea is that attacks, such as worms, have a recognizable signature—for example, a particular combination of header values or a unique byte-string embedded in the payload—and that the IDS can be programmed with a rule to recognize the attack traffic, and raise alerts when this happens. As an IPS, Snort now takes the additional step of blocking the attack.

Further Reading

[Snort: Open Source Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)](https://snort.org/).

Like firewalls, IDS and IPS need to see all the traffic traversing a network if they are to detect attacks, and so strategic placement is important. That leads to the same concerns about east-west traffic that we discussed above, and thus there are also distributed versions of these systems.

For an IDS/IPS that uses packet signatures to be effective, the set of potential attacks need to have been spotted in the wild and analyzed so that suitable rules can be formulated. Sharing rules among a community of users helps to speed up this process, and commercial IDS/IPS systems typically come with a subscription to a frequently-updated rules database. (See the Snort website referenced above for an example set of community rules.)

Another approach to using signatures is to look for *anomalies*—patterns in the behavior of traffic that somehow stand out from “normal” and can be categorized as a potential attack. Clearly this approach is attractive in that novel attacks can be detected before they make it into a rule database. The hard part is achieving high detection accuracy. Anomaly detection typically relies on machine learning algorithms to classify traffic as “normal” or “anomalous”. Because both signature-based and anomaly-based detection have their respective strengths and weaknesses, it is common to find both approaches used in modern IDS/IPS systems.

The proliferation of security appliances again highlights the principle of defense in depth. For example, if we had a perfect firewall, we might not require an IDS or IPS. However, knowing that firewalls will never block all forms of malicious traffic leads to the conclusion that an IDS/IPS is worth having as a second line of defense.
