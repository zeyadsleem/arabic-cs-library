The field of network security is roughly as old as networking itself. Conventional wisdom tells us that the original Internet was built without security features and we have been dealing with the effects of those design decisions ever since. It is not that the Internet’s designers, implementers and architects were unaware of security concerns; many of them were directly involved in developing security technologies in early operating systems. But building a high-performance network that could scale to global proportions and accommodate the heterogeneous set of technologies that existed (and those still to come) presented more than enough challenges. To quote Internet pioneer Vint Cerf: *“getting this thing to work at all was non-trivial.”*

Adding security capabilities to the Internet and the systems connected to it has been a multi-decade effort. While there have been some notable successes, such as widespread adoption of Transport Layer Security (TLS), vulnerabilities continue to be found and exploited. In part this is because security is a “negative goal”: we are always trying to ensure that there are no more cracks in our defenses, and it is fundamentally impossible to prove that we are “done”. So security continues to evolve as new weaknesses are exploited and new mechanisms deployed to prevent further exploits.

We have been educating ourselves about network security since we wrote the first edition of *Computer Networks: A Systems Approach* in 1995. There is an adage in security circles that no-one should write their own cryptography code because it is so hard to get right, and something similar might be said about trying to write a security book. It is easy to make mistakes, especially if you are not deeply immersed in the security world and the “look for every possible weakness” mentality. We’ve had to make a few corrections over the years to our security section in the big textbook. It is our perspective on security as viewed in the broader networking context that we have endeavored to bring to the topic.

So why did we decide to write the current book? First, we saw an opportunity to write about security in a way that would make sense to a networking person. Also, we wanted to take more of a systems approach to the topic. While we always try to take a system-level view in everything we write, it’s easy with security to get bogged down in the details of individual components, such as cryptographic algorithms, without really tackling the systems issues. Cryptography is cool and interesting (in our view at least) but it isn’t really the main thing to focus on if you are building secure systems. So while we do explain the basics of cryptography here, it’s not the focus. We’re aiming to explain how a system that comprises many moving parts, both in the network and the end-system, can be made secure.

This question of focus caused us to examine how much we wanted to say about end-system security. There are entire books to be written on operating system security, processor architecture bugs such as Spectre and Meltdown, and mitigating or preventing malware such as viruses on end-systems. We made a conscious decision to draw a line around the network and focus there, recognizing that, just as TCP is an important network protocol that runs in end-systems, protocols like HTTPS and TLS need to be covered in a book on network security. In fact TLS provides an excellent case study in the system-level issues that come into play when you try to secure traffic that flows between end-systems over the Internet, and we devote an entire chapter to it.

With the never-ending set of threats and vulnerabilities that need to be dealt with, it is all too easy to start thinking of security as just a collection of point solutions to the problems that have been identified so far. But in fact there is a well-established set of principles that have been identified and written down by pioneers in the field. The principle of least privilege and defense in depth are two noteworthy examples. We have dedicated a chapter to exploring some of the most widely accepted principles, and then we see them applied repeatedly throughout the book. Perimeter firewalls, for example, can be a part of a defense in depth strategy, while distributed firewalls have been proposed as a way to apply least privilege to datacenter networks.

Inevitably there are security technologies and types of attack that we have not covered in this book. What we have tried to do is to give the reader a sense of the principles at work and the building blocks that exist to build secure systems, and then illustrate how the blocks can be assembled to tackle particular problems ranging from securing Web traffic to securing the routing system that underpins the Internet. Security is a never-ending set of challenges and there will always be new threats and solutions. This book aims to lay the foundation so you can understand the network security landscape as it continues to evolve.
