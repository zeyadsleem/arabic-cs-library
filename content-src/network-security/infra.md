In the preceding chapters we have focused on the security of end-systems connected to the Internet and on securing communication between parties as their traffic traverses the Internet. But the Internet itself consists of infrastructure, such as routers, that must also be defended against attacks. Two areas of particular concern are the interdomain routing system and the domain name system (DNS). Both systems routinely come under attack. They are also complex distributed systems. While distributing the routing and naming functions helps make these systems resilient to failure, many opportunities for attack exist. In this chapter we discuss some of the ongoing efforts to improve their resistance to attacks. [[1]](#id2)

The following discussion builds on some of the concepts introduced in previous chapters. Notably, the concept of public key infrastructure (PKI), which we introduced in Chapter 4 and which underpins the operation of TLS, plays an important role in securing infrastructure as well. While the principles of certificates and chains of trust apply in any PKI, the specifics of how certificates are distributed and what they refer to are different in each application. We describe the different approaches to PKI for infrastructure services in the following sections.

Availability of infrastructure, including resistance to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, is clearly important to the operation of the Internet. Mitigation of such attacks is increasingly handled by distributed infrastructure like content distribution networks (CDNs), as we discuss in the final section of this chapter.

## 8.1 BGP and Routing Security[](#bgp-and-routing-security)

In most respects, a router is just a special-purpose computer with some high-speed interfaces and specialized software to perform tasks such as route computation and advertisement. So routers need to be protected like end-systems, e.g., with strong passwords and multi-factor authentication, using access control lists and firewalls, etc. That is only a starting point, however, because the actual routing protocols themselves introduce opportunities for attack. BGP, the Border Gateway Protocol, is vulnerable to a wide range of attacks, and is the only routing protocol that is expected to cross the boundaries of a single administrative domain, so we focus our attention here.

The primary challenge in securing the Internet’s routing infrastructure boils down to this: how can you trust a routing announcement received via BGP? At first glance, this looks similar to the problem solved by TLS: how do we know that we’re talking to the web site we wanted to connect to? But there are multiple levels to this problem when it comes to inter-domain routing. When you have a secure, encrypted connection to your bank, you probably trust them to show you accurate information about your account (mostly—banks do make mistakes on occasions) and the secure connection protects it from modification by an attacker. A secure, encrypted connection to the website of the New York Times, however, doesn’t mean you should believe every word published by the New York Times. Similarly, a secure connection to a BGP speaker (a router running BGP) doesn’t imply that every route advertisement provided by that speaker is reliable. We need to look a bit more closely at how BGP works to see where the challenges lie.

BGP speakers advertise *paths* to reach *prefixes*. When a BGP speaker receives a set of path advertisements from its peers, it runs a route selection process to determine its preferred path to any prefix, using a large and flexible set of criteria to decide which path to select. The business relationships among providers play a central role in path selection. While a router might prefer a path to a given prefix that is shorter (as measured by the number of autonomous systems it contains) to one that is longer, that is not a hard rule (unlike intra-domain routing). The business relationships among the different service providers and customers play a central role in the ultimate choice of path. When a BGP speaker has chosen a path to reach a particular prefix, it may choose to re-advertise that path to other BGP speakers, either in the same AS or in another AS. Again, this depends on customer-provider relationships. For a more full discussion of how BGP works, refer to the section on inter-domain routing in our main textbook.

A BGP speaker needs to trust that the paths that it is receiving from its peers are correct, and this turns out to be a multi-faceted challenge. Geoff Huston, the Chief Scientist at APNIC, has written a useful taxonomy of the threats that BGP faces, all of which relate to the trust among peers.

The taxonomy asks the following questions of the communication between two BGP speakers:

- How is the BGP session protected from modification or disruption?
- How does a speaker verify the identity of its peer?
- How does a speaker verify the authenticity and completeness of the routing information received from a peer?
- How does a speaker know that the advertisements received actually represent the true forwarding state of the peer?
- How current is the information received, and is it still valid?

The first two bullets are versions of the authentication and integrity issues that we addressed in Chapter 5. There are some details specific to BGP that we cover below. The remaining challenges all relate to the correctness of routing information carried by BGP and turn out to be more difficult to address.

### 8.1.1 Authentication and Integrity[](#authentication-and-integrity)

Since BGP runs over a TCP connection, it was recommended for many years that the TCP connection be authenticated and integrity-protected using MD5 authentication. The MD5 authentication option for TCP is now viewed as insufficiently secure (due to known attacks on the MD5 algorithm). It also lacks dynamic key management and the ability to update the cryptographic algorithm, so it is now deprecated in favor of a more general TCP authentication option which is described in RFC 5925.

It might seem somewhat counterintuitive that BGP does not currently run over TLS, given the maturity and widespread adoption of that technology today. The explanation for this comes down to a combination of factors including history, inertia, and the different operational model of running BGP versus connecting to a remote website. For example, BGP sessions often run between directly connected routers at a peering point or Internet exchange points (IXPs) which allows for a simple TTL-based method to prevent spoofing. Privacy of BGP updates is considerably less important than authenticity. And as we shall see, there is a lot more to establishing the authenticity of a BGP advertisement that just authenticating the messages from a peer.

When BGP was being developed in the 1980s and 1990s, TLS was still far in the future, and packet encryption and decryption operations were generally quite computationally expensive. So it made sense that the initial focus was on authenticating messages, first using MD5 and then with updated algorithms, rather than providing the greater protection of encryption that TLS offers.

With this background, the idea of running BGP over TLS is an area of current research, and would offer potential benefits beyond simply adding privacy to BGP advertisements. Most notably, certificate management for TLS is now highly automated, which contrasts with the manual provisioning that must be performed when using MD5 or TCP-based authentication for BGP. The paper below on secure transport for BGP outlines this approach and suggests further enhancements that might further improve the security of BGP. However, in terms of the current state of the Internet, the recommended best practice for BGP sessions (described in RFC 7454) does not extend to running BGP over TLS.

Whether TLS or a more basic authentication mechanism is used, the effect is only to verify that the information came from the intended peer and has not been modified in transit. The much more challenging part of Internet routing security is in the validation of the routing information itself. When a peer announces a path to a certain prefix, how do we know that they really have this path?

### 8.1.2 Correctness of Routing Information[](#correctness-of-routing-information)

When a BGP speaker announces a path to a particular prefix, how do we know that they really have such a path? Do we know that they will use the path if asked to do so? Are they even authorized to use the path? The short answer to all these questions is that we don’t know, but there has been a multi-decade quest to build mechanisms that enable greater confidence in the correctness of such announcements. This quest, and the slowness of its progress, was well documented by Sharon Goldberg in 2014. While progress continues today, a more recent study by Testart and Clark from 2021 indicated that progress had remained slow. There are a number of reasons for the lack of progress, as we discuss below.

Let’s start with a simple and well-studied example. In 2008, ISPs in Pakistan were ordered by the government to block access to YouTube for users in the country. One ISP (Pakistan Telecom) chose to do this by advertising a route to a prefix that was within the range allocated to YouTube. In effect, the ISP announced “I have a good path to YouTube” so that it could then redirect traffic that would try to follow that path. The problem was that not only was this path not a viable way to reach YouTube, it was also a *more specific* path, that is, it was for a longer prefix than the true path to YouTube that was being advertised by other ASes. Since IP forwarding is based on the longest matching prefix in the routing table (“longest-prefix match”) the more specific path overrides the less specific path when packets match the longer prefix. This turned into a problem well beyond the boundaries of Pakistan when the ISP advertised the route upstream to a larger ISP. The upstream ISP now saw the more specific route as a distinct piece of routing information from the true, less specific route, and so it re-advertised this (false) path to its peers. Repeated application of this decision to accept the more specific path and re-advertise it caused much of the Internet to view the small ISP in Pakistan as a true path to YouTube. Within minutes a large percentage of the Internet was sending YouTube request traffic to Pakistan, causing a global outage for YouTube. Resolution was achieved by manual intervention at multiple ISPs to stop the global advertisement of the false path.

There are many other forms of attack possible on BGP, but they mostly take the form of a route being advertised and then propagated when it should not be. There is a relatively simple measure that should have prevented the incident described above: the provider AS immediately upstream from Pakistan Telecom should not have accepted the advertisement that said “I have a route to YouTube”. How would it know not to accept this? After all, BGP needs to be dynamic, so a newly advertised prefix is often going to be correct. One solution to this problem is the use of Internet Routing Registries (IRRs), which serve as databases mapping address prefixes to the ASes that are authorized to advertise them. In the prior example, since YouTube is not a customer of Pakistan Telecom, the IRR would show that the YouTube prefix should not be advertised by this AS. The responsibility to filter out the false announcement falls on the *upstream* ISP, who would need to periodically query one or more IRRs in order to maintain an up-to-date set of filters to apply to its downstream peers.

There are numerous issues with the IRR approach, including that this sort of filtering gets much more difficult the closer you get to the “core” of the Internet. It’s one thing to filter prefixes from an ISP that serves a modest number of customers in a single country; it’s another to filter prefixes coming from a large peer with global presence. Some obviously bad routes can be filtered but it’s very hard to get a complete picture sufficient to rule out anything incorrect that could be advertised. The set of rules that need to be configured on a BGP router for an ISP that carries hundreds of thousands of routes can also get very large.

There is also a question of whether all the information provided by an IRR can be trusted. We discuss approaches to building trust in the information provided by an IRR below.

Furthermore, as noted in the article “*Why Is It Taking So Long to Secure Internet Routing?*”, the incentives for prefix filtering are not well aligned. The cost of filtering falls on the AS that is immediately upstream of the misbehaving ISP, while the benefit accrues to some distant entity (YouTube in our example) who avoids the impact to their traffic thanks to the work of a provider with whom they have no relationship.

A more sophisticated approach relies on the use of cryptographically signed statements authorizing a particular AS to advertise paths to a particular prefix. This technology behind this is referred to as RPKI: Resource Public Key Infrastructure. RPKI builds on the concepts of cryptographic signatures and certificate hierarchies that we introduced in previous chapters.

RPKI provides a means by which entities involved in routing, such as the operator of an AS, can make assertions about information that is related to the advertisement of routes. These assertions take various forms depending on which part of the problem they aim to solve. We describe three different uses of the RPKI in the following sections.

### 8.1.3 Route Origin Validation (ROV)[](#route-origin-validation-rov)

The first use of RPKI is to allow an AS to prove that it is authorized to originate routing advertisements for specific address prefixes. A Route Origin Authorization (ROA) contains a certificate, an AS number, and a set of prefixes that the AS is authorized to advertise. The ROA is cryptographically signed by an entity that is itself trusted to provide this authorization, generally the organization to which this address prefix has been allocated. For example, an ISP typically is allocated a certain set of prefixes and may originate routing advertisements for those prefixes. An ROA allows the ISP to assert that it has the authority to make such an announcement, and for BGP speakers elsewhere in the Internet to validate that assertion.

Address allocation in the Internet is a hierarchical process. Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) are at the top of the hierarchy for address allocation. Their position in the hierarchy of address allocation makes them a logical place for the RPKI roots of trust, known as trust anchors. There are five RIRs globally (ARIN, RIPE, APNIC, AFRINIC and LACNIC) and each has a root certificate in the RPKI.

Hierarchical address allocation operates in the following manner. An RIR can allocate a chunk of address space to an ISP, and the ISP can sub-allocate from that chunk to each of its customers. There may be additional layers in this hierarchy. A hierarchy of certificates can be created to follow this hierarchy of address allocation. The RIRs form trust anchors from which chains of trust can be built, much the way a modern browser comes with a set of trusted root certificate authorities (CAs) so that the certificates issued by web sites, which are signed by CAs, can be checked for validity.

A key distinction between RPKI and the certificates that we are familiar with from TLS is this: the certificates in TLS are used to validate the *identity* of a web site (e.g., a certificate for cnn.com tells your browser that it is actually talking to the entity that operates cnn.com), whereas RPKI certificates are used to validate the *resources* allocated to an entity such as an ISP or an end customer. The resources in the case of ROA certificates are IP address prefixes. As IP address allocation starts with the RIRs and proceeds down through ISPs to end customers, resource certificates are generated at each level in the hierarchy.

[![_images/rpki.png](/images/network-security/infra-0-rpki.webp)](_images/rpki.png)

Figure 24. Chain of trust for RPKI.[](#id3)

[Figure 24](#fig-rpki) shows how the certificates are arranged for a simple example of an ISP *A* with customer *C*. There is a chain of trust from the root certificate to the customer, much like the sort of certification hierarchy we have seen used for TLS. However, because the goal here is ultimately to certify the authority of a certain AS to advertise a prefix, the details of the certificates are different from those used in TLS. For example, the certificate that ISP *A* issues, on the far right of the picture, says that some address prefix has been allocated to customer *C*, and includes the public key of customer C. This certificate is signed by ISP *A* using the private key of *A*. So if we can trust *A*, we learn two things about *C*: its public key and the set of addresses allocated to the holder of that public key. Note that we don’t learn who *C* is (unlike a TLS certificate); we just learn the public key of the entity that is authorized to originate routing advertisements for some prefix or prefixes.

One level higher in the chain, the Regional Internet Registry (RIR) has issued a certificate that states ISP *A* has authority to allocate addresses out of some prefix. The prefix that *A* has allocated to *C* must be a subprefix within the allocation made by the RIR. By following the chain back to the root certificate, it is possible to establish that *C* is legitimately able to advertise the prefix allocated to it by *A*.

At this point we have created a set of bindings between public keys, which are held by entities such as Internet Registries, ISPs, and end customers, and IP address prefixes allocated to those entities. The next step is to create a Route Origin Authorization (ROA), which is a cryptographically signed object that associates a prefix with an AS that is authorized to originate routing advertisements for that prefix.

In our example above, *C* creates an ROA which it signs with its private key. The ROA contains the AS number of *C* and the prefix or prefixes that it wishes to advertise. Anyone who looks at the ROA and the resource certificate chain that leads from the root CA to *C* can validate that it has been signed with the private key belonging to C; they can also check that C is authorized to advertise the prefixes contained in the ROA. Because the ROA also contains the AS number for *C*, we now know that we should trust advertisements of this prefix if they originate from the stated AS. Furthermore, an ROA may limit the maximum length of the prefix to protect against bogus advertisements of more specific routes to a sub-prefix.

[![_images/ROA-trust.png](/images/network-security/infra-1-ROA-trust.webp)](_images/ROA-trust.png)

Figure 25. An ROA has a chain of trust back to the RPKI root.[](#id4)

Rather than being passed around in real time like certificates in TLS, the RPKI certificates and ROAs are stored in repositories, which are typically operated by the RIRs. Address allocations happen at a relatively long timescale, and certificates can be issued at the same time. Thus it is feasible to fetch the entire contents of the RPKI repository to build up a complete picture of the chains of certificates and signed ROAs that have been issued. With this information, ISPs use validation tools to determine *in advance* which ASes could originate routing advertisements for which prefixes. When a router that participates in BGP receives a new announcement, it can check its validity against the local validation tool.

Note the contrast to prior uses of certificates we have seen: a local validator builds a complete picture of the certificate hierarchy *a priori* in readiness for subsequent routing decisions, rather than checking the validity of certificates as part of establishing a session (as happens in TLS, for example). The repositories now become an essential part of our routing infrastructure and must themselves be secured and protected against DoS attacks.

There is a well-established set of software tools to automate the process of leveraging the RPKI for popular operating systems and commercial routing platforms. Notably, the routers running BGP do not perform cryptographic operations in real time when processing route advertisements; all the cryptographic operations happen in advance on servers that are external to the routers themselves. The external validator systems answer queries about the validity of BGP advertisements based on information they have downloaded from the RPKI repository.

With the RPKI in place it is now possible to perform Route Origin Validation (ROV). That is, if a given AS claims to be the originator of a certain prefix, that claim can be checked against the information in the RPKI. So, for example, if Pakistan Telecom were now to claim to be the origin AS for a subprefix of YouTube, that could immediately be detected as false information and discarded by any router receiving such an advertisement, not just the neighbors of the offending ISP.

[![_images/RPKI-system.png](/images/network-security/infra-2-RPKI-system.webp)](_images/RPKI-system.png)

Figure 26. Each AS maintains a local cache of the RPKI repository, and BGP speakers query the local cache, allowing them to validate BGP advertisements.[](#id5)

Some of the practical aspects of ROV are shown in [Figure 26](#fig-rpki-sys). An AS performing route origin validation maintains a local cache of the RPKI repository, which is fetched using rsync or the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP). A BGP speaker in the AS retrieves the set of valid ROAs by querying the local cache, using another protocol called the RPKI-to-router (RTR) protocol. This protocol allows the router to receive periodic updates to the set of valid ROAs from the local cache. With this information in hand, the router is able to check the validity of the originating AS in BGP advertisements that it receives from other ASes.

While there are many forms of attack or misconfiguration that would not be caught by ROV (particularly an AS falsely advertising a path that doesn’t actually exist to a valid originating AS) it does prevent a large number of issues, especially those caused by misconfiguration. To more fully combat the advertisement of false information in BGP, it is necessary to adopt some sort of path validation, as discussed below.

The adoption of RPKI for route origin validation has been moving along steadily for several years now. The adoption of ROAs is tracked by NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the U.S.)—see the Further Reading section. At the time of writing, the NIST RPKI monitor indicates that of the one-million-plus routes advertised globally in BGP, about 56% are covered by valid ROAs. Less than 2% are detected as invalid (the ROV check fails) while the remaining 42% do not contain ROA information. Looking at the deployment over time we can see a steady increase in valid ROA and a corresponding decrease in the “not found” group—the advertisements with no ROA. While 56% is a long way from 100%, this level of penetration is a significant accomplishment—especially given the historical difficulty of making changes to Internet routing and the “core” of the Internet.

One final point of note about the RPKI is that, just like other forms of certificate infrastructure, it relies on Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) to revoke certificates. This is important for handling cases such as the re-allocation of an address prefix from one provider to another. The good news is that CRLs are distributed from the RPKI repositories just like other objects in the RPKI.

### 8.1.4 Path Validation (BGPsec)[](#path-validation-bgpsec)

Route origin validation only tackles part of the problem with BGP security. Even if the originating AS can be shown to be valid, what do we know about the rest of the path? For example, if a malicious ISP has a valid path to a certain prefix that traverses five ASes, but chooses to falsely advertise that it can reach that prefix in two AS hops, it is likely to attract traffic destined for that prefix. Whatever the motive for such a step may be (e.g., to increase revenue or to censor certain traffic, or even simple misconfiguration) it clearly undermines the correct operation of Internet routing. The solution to such attacks is to validate not just the originator of a prefix but the entire path. It turns out this is a considerably harder problem to solve than ROV.

There are a few different proposals for how to securely validate paths. We focus here on the BGPsec standard from the IETF which illustrates the overall approach and the challenges with achieving widespread deployment.

In contrast to ROV, BGPsec path validation relies on cryptographic operations being adopted as part of BGP itself. Each BGP speaker (router) taking part in path validation signs its BGP announcements using a private key specific to the router. The public key corresponding to such a private key is included in a certificate that is published in the RPKI. Such certificates also include the AS number or numbers corresponding to the AS in which the router is located.

As with all public key certificates, we need a chain of trust from a trusted root to the router certificate. For example, an RIR could provide the root of trust, and sign certificates for ISPs, who could then act as the certificate authorities for their own routers. The use of the word “could” in this paragraph reflects the lack of real-world deployment of BGPsec.

With a certificate hierarchy in place, anyone receiving such a BGP announcement can verify that it came from a router within the AS that it claims to represent, and that it has not been modified in transit. The RPKI enables the recipient to obtain the public key corresponding to the announcing AS and thus validate the message.

The harder part of the problem is validating that the *contents* of the message are correct from the perspective of BGP. Since a BGP announcement is an ordered list of ASes, each of which has added itself into the path to the destination, we need to validate that every AS in the path has correctly announced a route to the destination when it added itself into the path.

The way this is achieved is to have every router that adds an AS to the path sign its announcement. We saw above that the RPKI could be used to create bindings between public keys and entities authorized to advertise a particular prefix. For path validation, we use the RPKI to create bindings between public keys and Autonomous Systems. With the RPKI in place, every router participating in BGPsec can be assumed to have a well-known public key and matching private key.

Now consider the process of constructing a path to a particular prefix. The path consists of a set of ASes. For example, a router in AS1, the origin AS, signs an announcement that says it is the origin for the prefix, using its private key. Furthermore, it includes the number of the target AS, AS2, to which it is sending the announcement, in the set of fields covered by the signature. Thus, we end up with a message that says “AS1 can reach prefix P and has sent this information to AS2” signed by a router from AS1.

A router in AS2 receives this announcement, and, having validated the signature, it can now add itself to the path. The router in AS2 can now issue a signed announcement that says “the path <AS2,AS1> leads to prefix P” and sign this using its private key. It includes the full signed message from AS1 as well as the new path. Again, before signing, it includes the number of the target AS to which it is sending this announcement. This announcement is received by AS3 which can now add itself to the path and sign the result, and so on.

Including the target AS in the material that is signed is essential to the correct operation of BGPsec. Suppose that, for example, AS3 tries to lie about the path it has to AS1, claiming that the path <AS3,AS1> is valid (skipping over AS2). It can’t construct a valid message to make this claim with the information that it received from AS2, because AS2 is the target given by AS1. An attempt to create a signed path <AS3,AS1> could be detected as invalid, because the signed statement from AS1 indicates that its target was AS2, not AS3.

Thus, when a valid signed announcement is received, the receiver is able to validate that every AS in the chain to the destination has received an announcement of the rest of the path to the destination. While this still does not prove that the path to the destination will actually be able to carry data, it does prove that a set of announcements made their way along the stated path. It remains a possibility that some AS might have advertised a path that it will not honor—AS2, for example, might refuse (or be unable) to forward traffic from AS3 to AS1 in spite of having advertised the path. A particular concern is route leaks, in which misconfiguration causes an AS to advertise a route by mistake, with no intention of attracting traffic to that prefix. When such traffic arrives it might overwhelm the resources of the AS that accidentally advertised the route, causing traffic to be dropped.

Compared to ROV, the deployment story for path validation using BGPsec is disappointing. We’ve only described one of several proposals to cryptographically validate the paths advertised in BGP, but the sad fact is that there is little to no deployment of any of them. There are at least two challenges with path validation that contribute to this situation. One is that it is relatively costly to start performing cryptographic operations as part of BGP (in contrast to ROV, where cryptographic operations happen separately from the validation of BGP messages). The second is a “collective action problem”: when a single ISP pays the cost of implementing BGPsec, it does little if anything to improve the situation for that ISP. Only when a critical mass of ISPs are using BGPsec does it start to provide significant incremental benefits over ROV. Issuing an ROA, by contrast, immediately helps the provider who issues it. The situation is captured in the paper “BGP Security in Partial Deployment”. An approach that holds promise to address both these issues is described in the following section.

### 8.1.5 AS Provider Authorization (ASPA)[](#as-provider-authorization-aspa)

At the time of writing, there is an effort underway at the IETF to standardize an approach to path validation known as ASPA (AS Provider Authorization). The idea is to use a new set of objects in the RPKI to capture the relationships among ASes, and then use that information to check the validity of BGP advertisements as they are received.

ASPA shares an attractive property with ROV: no cryptographic operations are added to BGP itself. Just as ROV builds a database (in the RPKI) of who is allowed to originate an advertisement, ASPA builds a database showing which ASes provide transit to other ASes. This, too, uses the RPKI, but with different types of certificates, known as ASPA records.

An important ingredient in ASPA is the insight that the relationships between ASes can be placed into a small set of categories. First, if there is no BGP connection between a pair of ASes, they have no relationship—and hence we should never see this pair of ASes next to each other in an advertised path. For any pair of ASes that do interconnect, the relationship can normally be classified as customer-to-provider, or peer-to-peer. A customer depends on a provider to deliver traffic to and from their AS, and that means that it is expected that the provider’s AS number will appear in routing advertisements to reach the customer AS. Customer ASes, on the other hand, only deliver traffic to their provider ASes if it originates in the customer AS itself or comes from the customer’s customers.

The relationship between customers and providers is normally captured visually as “valley-free” routing. Routing advertisements flow “up” from customers to providers, then (optionally) across between peers, then down from providers to customers, as depicted in [Figure 27](#fig-valleyfree). In this figure, customer ASes are depicted below their provider AS, while the two ASes at the top have a peer-to-peer relationship. Valley-free routes have the property that they never start to go down (towards customers) and then head up again towards providers. The appearance of a valley is a strong indication of a route leak. A database that establishes the customer-to-provider relationships gives us the ability to detect such anomalies.

[![_images/valleyfree.png](/images/network-security/infra-3-valleyfree.webp)](_images/valleyfree.png)

Figure 27. Valley-free topology of Autonomous Systems.[](#id6)

Suppose that two ASes, X and Y, publish a list of their providers using ASPA objects in the RPKI. Let’s say that there is an ASPA object from AS Y that asserts AS X is one of its providers, as well as an ASPA object from AS X that does not include AS Y among its providers. If a router receives an advertisement in which Y appears to be a provider for X, this is clearly wrong and the router drops the advertisement. The question of how we can tell that a particular AS is a provider, customer, or peer of another AS is a bit subtle, but it depends on the properties of valley-free routing. We can’t have an arbitrary mix of customer-provider and provider-customer links in a valid path; there must be a set of paths going “up” towards providers followed by at most one lateral path followed by a set of paths going “down” towards customers. The more relationships that are placed in the RPKI, the more power a BGP speaker gains to detect paths that are invalid.

ASPA adds further security to the routing system beyond that offered by ROV, because it catches attacks where an AS announces routes where the origin AS is correct (i.e., covered by a valid ROA) but the path is not legitimate. Such attacks are known as forged-origin prefix hijacks.

Furthermore, ASPA catches some routing problems (such as accidental leakage of routes) that are not caught by BGPsec. This is because BGPsec shows that ASes are connected to each other but does not capture the customer-provider relationships. ASPA also provides benefits even if it is only partially deployed on a path, as the above example illustrates. In other words, it is amenable to incremental deployment.

## 8.2 DNS and Naming Security[](#dns-and-naming-security)

The Domain Name System (DNS) is, like BGP, another critical component of the Internet’s infrastructure that has come under repeated attack in the decades since it was first introduced. Also like BGP, it was developed in an era when attacks on the Internet were not a top concern of protocol designers.

If you need a refresher on how DNS operates, see the section in our main textbook listed below. DNS queries and responses are sent between name servers as UDP datagrams, unprotected by encryption or authentication. Thus, the recipient of a DNS response is unable to determine who sent it—just because it looks like a reply to the query doesn’t mean it came from the server to which the query was sent. Nor can the recipient establish whether it contains valid information. And it turns out to be relatively easy to send false responses to DNS requests that can fool the recipients. Because of the way DNS caches responses, the impact of such false information can be widespread.

“Cache poisoning”—also sometimes referred to as DNS spoofing—is a common form of attack on DNS. If an attacker can either force a resolver to make a recursive query to an authoritative name server, or predict roughly when such a query is to be made, the attacker can try to send a fake response to *that* query. [Figures 28](#fig-dns) and [29](#fig-poison) show an example.

[![_images/DNS-example.png](/images/network-security/infra-4-DNS-example.webp)](_images/DNS-example.png)

Figure 28. Example of DNS Resolution.[](#id7)

When everything works as intended, a client machine makes a query to the local DNS resolver, which, finding nothing in its cache, sends a query to an authoritative name server. This is one of the simplest scenarios for name resolution when the answer is not already cached locally. (There will often be multiple queries required at step 2.) The answer is returned by the authoritative server and then cached and returned to the client. Subsequent requests for the same query from any client served by the local resolver can now be served from the resolver’s cache without steps 2 and 3 taking place.

[![_images/DNS-poison.png](/images/network-security/infra-5-DNS-poison.webp)](_images/DNS-poison.png)

Figure 29. Attacker poisons DNS cache.[](#id8)

The cache poisoning attack depends on an attacker getting false information into the cache of a server, where it will stay until the TTL (time to live) for that information expires. A TTL is often on the order of an hour. There are many ways to do this; we sketch one possibility.

Suppose that the attacker is able to observe the client request (1) in [Figure 28](#fig-dns), perhaps by snooping on open WiFi. The attacker can now flood the resolver with fake versions of the expected response (3), hoping that with enough guesses they can generate a response that will be accepted by the resolver. The ID field in the DNS header is a 16-bit field and the server UDP port associated with DNS is a well-known value, so there are only \(2^{32}\) possible combinations of ID and client UDP port for a given client and server. That makes brute force attacks feasible.

Even with no visibility of the client traffic, the attacker can force the resolver to make queries to example.com by issuing queries of its own, and then send the flood of responses to impersonate the authoritative server. If successful, this leaves the fake data in the cache until its TTL expires. Other clients of the resolver will now get the bad result from the cache. There are many variations of this type of attack, broadly cataloged in RFC 3833, which analyzes the threats faced by DNS.

When the goal is to limit access to certain sites, rather than to redirect a client to a fake site, simply disrupting the process of DNS resolution is sufficient to make access to the target sites difficult for end users. The use of packet inspection to intercept DNS queries passing through a network and then to inject fake responses, or simply drop the query, is part of the suite of techniques used to control Internet access by national governments. See the Further Reading section for a thorough study on this phenomenon and its widespread effects in and beyond China.

### 8.2.1 DNS Amplification Attacks[](#dns-amplification-attacks)

There is a class of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that leverages the properties of DNS to attack other systems, rather than being an attack on DNS itself. Recall that DNS is UDP-based. A name server sends a response back to the IP address from which a query was sent, and since there is no TCP connection to establish, it is relatively easy to use a fake source address in a query. In this case, the name server can be tricked into sending traffic to some unsuspecting host. And it is not hard to see how this can be turned into a *distributed* denial-of-service attack: many hosts (e.g., a set of hosts in a botnet) can make coordinated requests to a set of name servers, with all the requests using the same spoofed source address. Not only does this lead to a lot of traffic heading to the target address, but the name servers can be make to perform a traffic *amplification* function, because the response to a DNS query can be much larger than the query that triggered it. In particular, the DNS query type “ANY” causes all records for a domain to be returned, which can be a lot of data returned for a simple query. The handling of such queries has recently been clarified in an RFC in a manner that should reduce the impact of ANY queries, but that is not a complete solution to DNS amplification attacks.

Three main steps can be taken to reduce these attacks. The first is to avoid the deployment of “open” resolvers, i.e., resolvers which will accept queries from anywhere. For example, the resolver for an enterprise should be configured such that only clients within that enterprise can send queries to it; it should not accept queries from the broader Internet.

The second step is source address validation. Source address filtering is a tool that can be applied at the boundaries of autonomous systems to reject traffic with spoofed source addresses. It may not be 100% effective but it will reduce the effectiveness of large scale attacks.

Finally, recall that there are general ways to deal with DoS attacks such as the use of content distribution networks and black-holing of DoS traffic. We discuss general approaches to DoS mitigation below.

### 8.2.2 DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)[](#dns-security-extensions-dnssec)

Since DNS queries in the original design are unauthenticated, cleartext UDP datagrams, a natural approach to preventing attacks on DNS would be to use some of the techniques outlined in Chapter 5 to authenticate DNS responses. That is precisely what the first big effort to improve DNS security, the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC), does.

The first step for DNSSEC is similar to an approach we have seen used in other scenarios: to establish chains of trusted public keys using a hierarchy of certificates. Recall that in DNS we have an existing hierarchical relationship between zones, with the root zone at the top, so it is natural to establish a certificate hierarchy following the zone hierarchy. As a reminder, see the example hierarchy from the section on DNS in our main textbook, reproduced below.

[![_images/f09-17-9780123850591.png](/images/network-security/infra-6-f09-17-9780123850591.webp)](_images/f09-17-9780123850591.png)

Figure 30. Hierarchy of DNS name servers.[](#id9)

Suppose, for example, an administrator of the princeton.edu domain wants to start signing the responses issued by the nameserver they operate. They need to obtain a certificate for the public key that they plan to use, and that certificate will be issued and signed by the .edu domain. The .edu domain in turn requires a certificate to establish that their key can be trusted, and that certificate is issued and signed by the root domain. As with other systems such as TLS certificates, establishing a root of trust must be done by some out-of-band mechanism. There is actually an elaborate, formal process for generating the root key—a signing ceremony with multiple participants and auditors—that enables the keys for the root zone to be trusted.

While there are obvious similarities to the chains of trust used for TLS, the notable difference here is that the chain of certificates that must be followed is precisely defined by the hierarchy of the DNS. Whereas a TLS certificate could be issued by a range of certificate authorities, the certificates for any zone in DNSSEC must be issued by the parent zone. This has some advantages, such as limiting the opportunities for bad behavior by CAs that has occasionally occurred with TLS certificates. However, it also introduces a weakness: if your parent zone, or any zone in the path between the zone seeking a certificate and the root, is not using DNSSEC, then this zone is unable to use DNSSEC. To put it another way, DNSSEC starts at the top of the zone hierarchy and flows down to the leaves, and any zone along that path that fails to implement DNSSEC prevents its children from implementing DNSSEC. For example, using our figure above, if princeton.edu does not implement DNSSEC, the CS department would be out of luck if they wanted to implement it, since they could not get their key signed by the parent zone.

For a real-world example of DNSSEC in use, we set up the domain systemsapproach.org to use DNSSEC. To test that it was actually working, we used the open source tool DNSviz to check whether our zone was being correctly signed. DNSviz produces a detailed report that can be captured graphically, as shown in [Figure 31](#fig-dnsviz). The main thing to observe in this figure is the 3-layer hierarchy from the root zone to the .org zone to the systemsapproach.org zone, where the parent zone signs the key for the child zone so that signatures from the child zone can then be validated by DNS resolvers.

[![_images/dnsviz.png](/images/network-security/infra-7-dnsviz.webp)](_images/dnsviz.png)

Figure 31. Validation of DNS keys and signatures by DNSviz.[](#id10)

The requirement to implement at every level from root to leaf is one of the barriers to DNSSEC adoption that is cited in an article by Geoff Huston of APNIC about the poor deployment of the technology (see Further Reading). Given that the work to secure DNS has been going on for over thirty years now, and it has yet to reach 40% deployment (based on measurements reported by APNIC and the Internet Society), it is reasonable to ask whether it is ever likely to succeed. Huston notes a number of other reasons why its success has been limited, not least of which is that TLS, while solving a different problem, somewhat sidesteps the need for validating DNS. If you know that you are connected to the correct web site using HTTPS because it has proven its identity using a TLS certificate that you trust, do you really care what IP address was used by the underlying protocols to connect you to the web site?

This is not to say that protecting DNS is unimportant, however. Interference with DNS is still a vector for censorship and surveillance of Internet usage. Subverting DNS to direct a client to a site other than the one they intended to reach undermines the operation of the Internet. While DNSSEC has struggled to gain traction, other methods of protecting DNS have appeared more recently and are having some impact, as discussed in the next section.

The challenges of securing DNS illustrate a point we made early in the book about the trusted computing base (TCB) and minimizing its size. If DNS needs to be trusted in order for systems that depend on the Internet to operate securely, then we have chosen a large, distributed system component that needs to be made secure. Having largely failed to make DNS secure over thirty years, it is a good thing that TLS (and other systems using end-to-end encryption) provides secure communications over untrusted infrastructure. In other words we have excluded DNS from the TCB.

A final note on DNSSEC is that, by making responses larger, it has the potential to worsen amplification attacks. The response to a request to a DNS server that implements DNSSEC contains both a signature and the key used to verify the signature. That’s a significant increase in the number of bytes returned for a single query. The mitigation techniques outlined above—source address filtering and DoS prevention—can still be applied. Additionally, there is an advantage to using cryptographic algorithms that use relatively short keys. For this reason the ECDSA algorithm may be preferred to RSA, since ECDSA keys are considerably shorter than RSA keys for comparable levels of security.

This small detail illustrates how much of security consists of making tradeoffs. While adding DNSSEC is a positive in terms of securing the DNS itself, it has contributed to the risk of DoS attacks leveraging DNS amplification. Adding security almost always imposes some costs—it is important to be aware of them and to ensure that the payoff for an additional mechanism justifies its costs.

### 8.2.3 Encrypted DNS (DoH, DoT, ODNS)[](#encrypted-dns-doh-dot-odns)

With the widespread adoption of TLS to encrypt and authenticate HTTP traffic, as discussed in Chapter 6, it should come as no surprise that there are now a number of standard ways to send DNS queries and responses over TLS-secured channels. There have been a few similar proposals to achieve this outcome, with the IETF having standardized both DNS over TLS (DoT) in RFC 7858, and DNS over HTTPS (DoH) in RFC 8484. There is some debate about the merits of each but for the purposes of our discussion the differences are not terribly significant.

The basic idea behind both approaches is simple enough. Rather than sending DNS queries and responses as plaintext UDP datagrams, the DNS client establishes a TLS or HTTPS connection to the DNS resolver, and then issues queries as requests within that encrypted channel. The details of how to encode the requests and responses are spelled out in the RFCs and we need not dwell on them here.

It’s worth noting that, in contrast to DNSSEC, DoH and DoT provide no assurance that the DNS information being provided by the resolver is correct. We can be sure of the identity of the resolver we are connected to, since that is provided by its TLS certificate. And we know that the query sent and response issued by the resolver have not been modified or observed by an intermediary, since they are both encrypted and authenticated. But if the resolver itself is giving bad information, perhaps because the information provided to it from upstream in the DNS hierarchy has been corrupted, the client will be none the wiser. So while the need to deploy DNSSEC all the way along the hierarchy is something of an impediment to deployment, it does provide a level of security that isn’t provided by simply securing the client-to-resolver channel.

Another notable security risk that is not addressed by any of the approaches discussed to this point is the privacy of the client making the queries. The resolver has access to all the client requests in unencrypted form, which would seem to be a requirement for those requests to be served. However, there have been efforts to improve the privacy of client requests using a technique known as *Oblivious DNS*.

[![_images/DNS-oblivious.png](/images/network-security/infra-8-DNS-oblivious.webp)](_images/DNS-oblivious.png)

Figure 32. Oblivious DNS.[](#id11)

The central idea in oblivious DNS is to hide the identity of the client from the resolver. This is done by leveraging DoH to encrypt the requests from the client and the responses sent to the client, using a key that is associated with the target. But rather than send the queries direct to the target, as in standard DoH, oblivious DNS inserts a proxy between client and target. So the proxy gets an encrypted request that it cannot interpret, and then passes the request on to the target. The target can decrypt the request but doesn’t know which client sent it, and sends an encrypted response back to the proxy. As long as the proxy supports a mix of clients, and and the proxy and target do not collude, neither of them has the information to figure out what queries a given client is making.

Oblivious DNS is an experimental protocol but there are some deployments already available of both the proxy and target behavior. Notably, Apple has built a privacy-focused service that combines oblivious DNS with several other technologies to support private browsing. Large CDN operators such as Cloudflare have support for the target function.

## 8.3 DoS Mitigation[](#dos-mitigation)

In much of this book we have focused on attacks against the confidentiality or integrity of information, but we also need to concern ourselves with availability. This is true for both end systems (such as web sites) and the infrastructure of the network itself. Commonly known as *Denial of Service (DoS)* attacks, such attacks typically involve an adversary trying to overwhelm “good” resources (link bandwidth, packet forwarding rates, server response throughput) with traffic generated by “bad” resources (such as botnets constructed from a distributed collection of compromised devices). Patching of vulnerabilities and the deployment of security appliances such as firewalls can help protect devices from being compromised in the first place, but they are not perfect—new vulnerabilities appear constantly and a human is often the weakest link. Hence we also need ways to mitigate the impact of *Distributed DoS (DDoS)* attacks. This is another example of defense in depth: protect devices against being compromised, and also protect against the attacks launched by compromised devices.

Keeping in mind that DDoS traffic typically looks legitimate (there’s just too much of it), the DDoS challenge is addressed by two general countermeasures. Note that the best we can hope for is to mitigate the impact of such attacks; there is no cure-all. This is easy to understand at an intuitive level: any systems that we deploy to defend against DoS attacks represent a kind of resource that can itself be DoSed. Thus DoS mitigation solutions tend to be distributed themselves.

The first countermeasure is to absorb potential attacks with even greater resources than the adversary is able to muster. For web content, this is done using the same mechanism as is used to absorb flash crowds of legitimate traffic: a *Content Distribution Network (CDN).* The idea is to replicate content (whether it’s a movie or a critical piece of infrastructure metadata) across many widely-distributed servers. As long as the aggregate capacity of these servers is greater than the aggregate capacity of the botnet—and the CDN does a good job spreading requests across the available servers—content remains available. This notion of *aggregate* capacity generalizes beyond web servers responding to HTTP GET requests. A network is itself a distributed collection of forwarding and transmission resources, engineered to distribute those resources in a way that avoids vulnerable bottlenecks. The DNS illustrates this perfectly: it is a highly distributed system designed to avoid single points of failure with redundancy at all levels of the hierarchy.

The second countermeasure is to filter malicious traffic as early (close to the source) as possible. If a DoS attack comes from a single source, then it is easy to “block” traffic from that source at an ingress to a network you control. This is why DoS attacks are typically distributed. Dropping (or rate limiting) attack packets at the boundary router for a service provider (or at a firewall for an enterprise) is better than allowing those packets to flood the core of the network and reach a victim server(s), but the more widely distributed the periphery of your network, the earlier you can filter malicious packets. And drawing on the first countermeasure, the more widely distributed your network resources are, the greater your aggregate filtering capacity. Global overlay networks, as provided by companies like Cloudflare and Fastly, offer a combination of content distribution and distributed packet filtering. These are commercial products, with many proprietary details, but the general principles outlined here explain their underlying strategy.

Finally, note that DoS attacks highlight the never-ending nature of tackling security. Almost any protocol or system can by a target of a DoS attack. We discussed the role of DNS in amplification of DoS attacks in the preceding section. When attacks are launched against web sites, attackers are often taking advantage of the HTTP protocol—significant server resources are consumed responding to bogus GET requests. As a very different example, the forwarding of IP packets can be attacked with a “Christmas Tree” packet, one that has multiple options turned on (i.e., is “lit up like a Christmas tree”), where each option requires IP to execute instructions it would not normally execute to forward a typical packet. A router with a naive implementation of IP would be at risk of not being able to forward packets at line speed if it’s busy processing the options. For this reason, routers typically implement a “fast path” that is able to keep pace with line speeds and a “slow path” that processes exceptional packets, and most importantly, they quickly determine which path each packet should be assigned to. This is a variant of the second countermeasure—decide early to protect resources.

Another well-known example is a “SYN Flood” targeting TCP, whereby an attacker floods a server with SYN requests without any intent to complete the TCP handshake and actually establish a connection. This overloads TCP’s connection table, potentially denying connections to legitimate clients. An Intrusion Detection System (see the next chapter) can help protect servers since a flood of SYN packets is anomalous behavior, but individual servers can also limit the impact by encoding connection state in the sequence number included in the SYN+ACK they send back to the client—a “SYN cookie” of sorts—and then allocate connection state locally only after the client goes to the trouble of correctly ACKing that packet. This is a variant of the first countermeasure in that it forces the attacker to use additional resources.

These examples are just a few of many illustrating the need to program defensively. This is especially true for protocols since they are purposely designed to process messages from remote sources, exposing them to attempts to crash, hack, or as in the case of DoS attacks, simply consume the system. Defensive programming ventures outside the scope of this book, but the referenced OSDI paper is an example of one approach.
