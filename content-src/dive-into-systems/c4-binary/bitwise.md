In addition to the standard arithmetic operations described earlier, CPUs also support operations that are uncommon outside of binary. These **bitwise operators** directly apply the behavior of [logic gates](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C5-Arch/gates.html#_basic_logic_gates) to bit sequences, making them straightforward to implement efficiently in hardware. Unlike addition and subtraction, which programmers typically use to manipulate a variable’s numerical interpretation, programmers commonly use bitwise operators to modify specific bits in a variable. For example, a program might encode a certain bit position in a variable to hold a true/false meaning, and bitwise operations allow the program to manipulate the variable’s individual bits to change that specific bit.

### [](#_bitwise_and)4.6.1. Bitwise AND

The bitwise AND operator (`&`) evaluates two input bit sequences. For each digit of the inputs, it outputs a 1 in the corresponding position of the output if *both* inputs are 1 in that position. Otherwise, it outputs a 0 for the digit. [Table 1](#TabANDTruth) shows the truth table for the bitwise AND of two values, *A* and *B*.

| A | B | A & B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

For example, to bitwise AND 0b011010 with 0b110110, start by lining up the two sequences. Checking vertically through each digit, set the result of the column to 1 if *both* digits are 1. Otherwise, set the result of the column to 0:

```
        011010
    AND 110110  Only digits 1 and 4 are 1's in BOTH inputs, so
Result: 010010  those are the only digits set to 1 in the output.
```

To perform a bitwise AND in C, place C’s bitwise AND operator (`&`) between two operand variables. Here’s the same example again, performed in C:

```c
int x = 26;
int y = 54;

printf("Result: %d\n", x & y);  // Prints 18
```

**Warning — Bitwise Operations versus Logical Truth Operations**

> Be careful not to conflate bitwise operators with [logical truth operators](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C1-C_intro/conditionals.html#_boolean_values_in_c). Despite having similar names (AND, OR, NOT, etc.), the two *are not* the same:
>
> - Bitwise operators consider each bit of their inputs independently and produce an output bit sequence as a function of the specific input bits that are set.
> - Logical operators consider only the *truth* interpretation of their operands. To C, a value of zero is *false*, whereas all other values are considered *true*. Logical operators are often used when evaluating conditionals (e.g., `if` statements).
>
> Note that C often uses similar (but slightly different) operators to distinguish between the two. For example, you can indicate bitwise AND and bitwise OR using a single `&` and `|`, respectively. Logical AND and logical OR correspond to a double `&&` and `||`. Finally, bitwise NOT uses `~`, whereas logical NOT is expressed by `!`.

### [](#_bitwise_or)4.6.2. Bitwise OR

The bitwise OR operator (`|`) behaves like the bitwise AND operator except that it outputs a 1 for a digit if *either or both* of the inputs is 1 in the corresponding position. Otherwise, it outputs a 0 for the digit. [Table 2](#TabORTruth) shows the truth table for the bitwise OR of two values, *A* and *B*.

| A | B | A | B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

For example, to bitwise OR 0b011010 with 0b110110, start by lining up the two sequences. Checking vertically through each digit, set the result of the column to 1 if *either* digit is 1:

```
        011010
     OR 110110     Only digit 0 contains a 0 in both inputs, so it's
Result: 111110     the only digit not set to 1 in the result.
```

To perform a bitwise OR in C, place C’s bitwise OR operator (`|`) between two operands. Here’s the same example again, performed in C:

```c
int x = 26;
int y = 54;

printf("Result: %d\n", x | y);  // Prints 62
```

### [](#_bitwise_xor_exclusive_or)4.6.3. Bitwise XOR (Exclusive OR)

The bitwise XOR operator (`^`) behaves like the bitwise OR operator except that it outputs a 1 for a digit only if *exactly one* (but not both) of the inputs is 1 in the corresponding position. Otherwise, it outputs a 0 for the digit. [Table 3](#TabXORTruth) shows the truth table for the bitwise XOR of two values, *A* and *B*.

| A | B | A ^ B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

For example, to bitwise XOR 0b011010 with 0b110110, start by lining up the two sequences. Checking vertically through each digit, set the result of the column to 1 if *only one* digit is 1:

```
        011010
    XOR 110110     Digits 2, 3, and 6 contain a 1 in exactly one of
Result: 101100     the two inputs.
```

To perform a bitwise XOR in C, place C’s bitwise XOR operator (`^`) between two operands. Here’s the same example again, performed in C:

```c
int x = 26;
int y = 54;

printf("Result: %d\n", x ^ y);  // Prints 44
```

### [](#_bitwise_not)4.6.4. Bitwise NOT

The bitwise NOT operator (`~`) operates on just one operand. For each bit in the sequence, it simply flips the bit such that a zero becomes a one or vice versa. [Table 4](#TabNOTTruth) shows the truth table for the bitwise NOT operator.

| A | ~ A |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 |

For example, to bitwise NOT 0b011010, invert the value of each bit:

```
    NOT 011010
Result: 100101
```

To perform a bitwise NOT in C, place a tilde character (`~`) in front of an operand. Here’s the same example again, performed in C:

```c
int x = 26;

printf("Result: %d\n", ~x); // Prints -27
```

**Warning — Bitwise NOT vs. Negation**

> Note that all modern systems represent integers using two’s complement, so bitwise NOT isn’t quite the same as negation. Bitwise NOT *only* flips the bits and *doesn’t* add one.

### [](#_bit_shifting)4.6.5. Bit Shifting

Another important bitwise operation involves shifting the position of an operand’s bits either to the left (`>`). Both the left and right shifting operators take two operands: the bit sequence to shift and the number of places it should be shifted.

#### [](#_shifting_left)Shifting Left

Shifting a sequence to the left by *N* places moves each of its bits to the left *N* times, appending new zeros to the right side of the sequence. For example, shifting the eight-bit sequence 0b00101101 to the left by two produces 0b101101**00**. The two zeros at the right are appended to end of the sequence, since the result still needs to be an eight-bit sequence.

In the absence of overflow, shifting to the left *increases* the value of the result because bits move toward digits that contribute larger powers of two to the value of the number. However, with a fixed number of bits, any bits that shift into positions beyond the maximum capacity of the number get truncated. For example, shifting the eight-bit sequence 0b11110101 (unsigned interpretation 245) to the left by one produces 0b1110101**0** (unsigned interpretation 234). Here, the truncation of the high-order bit that shifted out makes the result smaller.

To perform a left bit shift in C, place two less-than characters (`<<`) between a value and the number of places to shift that value:

```c
int x = 13;  // 13 is 0b00001101

printf("Result: %d\n", x << 3);  // Prints 104 (0b01101000)
```

#### [](#_shifting_right)Shifting Right

Shifting to the right is similar to left shifting — any bits that are shifted out of a variable’s capacity (e.g., off the end to the right) disappear due to truncation. However, right shifting introduces an additional consideration: the new bits prepended to the left side of the result may need to be either all zeros or all ones depending on the *type* of the variable being shifted and its high-order bit value. Conceptually, the choice to prepend zeros or ones resembles that of [sign extension](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C4-Binary/signed.html#_sign_extension). Thus, there exist two distinct variants of right shifting:

- A **logical right shift** always prepends zeros to the high-order bits of the result. Logical shifting is used to shift *unsigned* variables, since a leading 1 in the most significant bit of an unsigned value isn’t intended to mean that the value is negative. For example, shifting 0b10110011 to the right by two using a logical shift yields 0b**00**101100.
- An **arithmetic right shift** prepends a copy of the shifted value’s most significant bit into each of the new bit positions. Arithmetic shifting applies to *signed* variables, for which it’s important to preserve the signedness of the high-order bits. For example, shifting 0b10110011 to the right by two using an arithmetic shift yields 0b**11**101100.

Fortunately, when programming in C, you don’t typically need to worry about the distinction if you’ve declared your variables properly. If your program includes a right shift operator (`>>`), virtually every C compiler will automatically perform the appropriate type of shifting according to the type of the shifting variable. That is, if the shifting variable was declared with the *unsigned* qualifier, the compiler will perform a logical shift. Otherwise, it will perform an arithmetic shift.

**Note — C Right Shift Example Program**

> You can test the behavior of right shifting with a small example program like this one:
>
> ```c
> #include <stdio.h>
>
> int main(int argc, char **argv) {
>     /* Unsigned integer value: u_val. */
>     unsigned int u_val = 0xFF000000;
>
>     /* Signed integer value: s_val. */
>     int s_val = 0xFF000000;
>
>     printf("%08X\n", u_val >> 12);  // logical right shift
>     printf("%08X\n", s_val >> 12);  // arithmetic right shift
>
>     return 0;
> }
> ```
>
> This program declares two 32-bit integers: one as an unsigned integer (`u_val`), and another as a signed integer (`s_val`). It initializes both integers to the same starting value: a sequence of eight ones followed by 24 zeros (`0b1111111100000000000000000000000000`), and then it shifts both values 12 positions to the right. When executed, it prints:
>
> ```bash
> $ ./a.out
> 000FF000
> FFFFF000
> ```
>
> Because a leading 1 doesn’t indicate "negative" for the unsigned `u_val`, the compiler uses instructions to prepend it with only zeros. The shifted result contains 12 zeros, eight ones, and 12 more zeros (`0b00000000000011111111000000000000`). On the other hand, the leading 1 **does** indicate "negative" for `s_val`, so the compiler prepends 1’s to the front of the shifted value, yielding 20 ones followed by 12 zeros (`0b11111111111111111111000000000000`).
