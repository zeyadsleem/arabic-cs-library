Let’s take a look at the `getSmallest` function in assembly. For convenience, the function is reproduced here.

```c
int getSmallest(int x, int y) {
    int smallest;
    if ( x > y ) {
        smallest = y;
    }
    else {
        smallest = x;
    }
    return smallest;
}
```

The corresponding assembly code extracted from GDB looks similar to the following:

```javascript
(gdb) disas getSmallest
Dump of assembler code for function getSmallest:
  0x8048411 <+6>:   mov    0x8(%ebp),%eax
  0x8048414 <+9>:   cmp    0xc(%ebp),%eax
  0x8048417 <+12>:  jle    0x8048421 <getSmallest+22>
  0x8048419 <+14>:  mov    0xc(%ebp),%eax
  0x804841f <+20>:  jmp    0x8048427 <getSmallest+28>
  0x8048421 <+22>:  mov    0x8(%ebp),%eax
  0x8048427 <+28>:  ret
```

This is a different view of the assembly code than we have seen before. Here, we can see the *address* associated with each instruction, but not the *bytes*. Note that this assembly segment has been lightly edited for the sake of simplicity. The instructions that are normally part of function creation/termination (i.e., `push %ebp` and `mov %esp, %ebp`) and for allocating space on the stack are removed. By convention, GCC places the first and second parameters of a function at locations `%ebp+8` and `%ebp+0xc` (or `%ebp+12`), respectively. For the sake of clarity, we refer to these parameters as `x` and `y` respectively.

Let’s trace through the first few lines of the previous assembly code snippet. Note that we will not draw out the stack explicitly in this example. We leave this as an exercise for the reader, and encourage you to practice your stack tracing skills by drawing it out yourself.

- The `mov` instruction copies the value located at address `%ebp+8` (the first parameter, `x`) and places it in register `%eax`. The instruction pointer (`%eip`) is set to the address of the next instruction, or 0x08048414.
- The `cmp` instruction compares the value at location `%ebp+12` (the second parameter, `y`) to `x` and sets appropriate condition code flag registers. Register `%eip` advances to the address of the next instruction, or 0x08048417.
- The `jle` instruction on the third line indicates that if `x` is less than or equal to `y`, the next instruction that executes is at location `` (or `mov 0x8(%ebp), %eax`) and that `%eip` should be set to address 0x8048421. Otherwise, `%eip` is set to the next instruction in sequence, or 0x8048419.

The next instructions to execute depend on whether the program follows the branch (i.e., executes the jump) on line 3 (``). Let’s first suppose that the branch was *not* followed. In this case, `%eip` is set to 0x8048419 (i.e., ``) and the following sequence of instructions executes:

- The `mov 0xc(%ebp),%eax` instruction at `` copies `y` to register `%eax`. Register `%eip` advances to 0x804841f.
- The `jmp` instruction sets register `%eip` to address 0x8048427.
- The last instruction to execute is the `ret` instruction, signifying the end of the function. In this case, `%eax` contains `y`, and `getSmallest` returns `y`.

Now, suppose that the branch was taken at ``. In other words, the `jle` instruction sets register `%eip` to 0x8048421 (i.e., ``). Then, the next instructions to execute are:

- The `mov 0x8(%ebp),%eax` instruction at address 0x8048421, which copies the `x` to register `%eax`. Register `%eip` advances to 0x8048427.
- The last instruction that executes is `ret`, signifying the end of the function. In this case, `%eax` contains `x`, and `getSmallest` returns `x`.

We can then annotate the preceding assembly as follows:

```javascript
0x8048411 <+6>:  mov 0x8(%ebp),%eax             #copy x to %eax
0x8048414 <+9>:  cmp 0xc(%ebp),%eax             #compare x with y
0x8048417 <+12>: jle 0x8048421 <getSmallest+22> #if x<=y goto<getSmallest+22>
0x8048419 <+14>: mov 0xc(%ebp),%eax             #copy y to %eax
0x804841f <+20>: jmp 0x8048427 <getSmallest+28> #goto <getSmallest+28>
0x8048421 <+22>: mov 0x8(%ebp),%eax             #copy x to %eax
0x8048427 <+28>: ret                            #exit function (return %eax)
```

Translating this back to C code yields:

**Table 1. Translating `getSmallest` into goto C form and C code.**

**goto Form**

```c
int getSmallest(int x, int y) {
    int smallest;
    if (x <= y) {
        goto assign_x;
    }
    smallest = y;
    goto done;

assign_x:
    smallest = x;

done:
    return smallest;
}
```

**Translated C code**

```c
int getSmallest(int x, int y) {
    int smallest;
    if (x <= y) {
        smallest = x;
    }
    else {
        smallest = y;
    }
    return smallest;
}
```

In [Table 1](#TranslateSmallest32), the variable `smallest` corresponds to register `%eax`. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, the code executes the statement `smallest = x`, which is associated with the `goto` label `assign_x` in our `goto` form of this function. Otherwise, the statement `smallest = y` is executed. The `goto` label `done` is used to indicate that the value in `smallest` should be returned.

Notice that the preceding C translation of the assembly code is a bit different from the original `getSmallest` function. These differences don’t matter; a close inspection of both functions reveals that the two programs are logically equivalent. However, the compiler first converts any `if` statement into an equivalent `goto` form, which results in the slightly different, but equivalent, version. [Table 2](#StandardGotoIf32) shows the standard `if` statement format and its equivalent `goto` form:

**Table 2. Standard `if`-statement format and its equivalent `goto` form.**

**C `if`-statement**

```c
if (condition) {
    then_statement;
}
else {
    else_statement;
}
```

**Compiler’s equivalent `goto` form**

```c
    if (!condition) {
        goto else;
    }
    then_statement;
    goto done;
else:
    else_statement;
done:
```

Compilers translating code into assembly designate a jump when a condition is true. Contrast this behavior with the structure of an `if` statement, where a "jump" (to the `else`) occurs when conditions are *not* true. The `goto` form captures this difference in logic.

Considering the original `goto` translation of the `getSmallest` function, we can see that:

- `x
- `smallest = x` is the `else_statement`.
- The line `smallest = y` is the `then_statement`.
- The last line in the function is `return smallest`.

Rewriting the original version of the function with the preceding annotations yields:

```c
int getSmallest(int x, int y) {
    int smallest;
    if (x > y) {     //!(x <= y)
        smallest = y; //then_statement
    }
    else {
        smallest = x; //else_statement
    }
    return smallest;
}
```

This version is identical to the original `getSmallest` function. Keep in mind that a function written in different ways in the C language can translate to the same set of assembly instructions.

#### [](#_the_cmov_instructions)The cmov Instructions

The last set of conditional instructions we cover are **conditional move** (`cmov`) instructions. The `cmp`, `test`, and `jmp` instructions implement a *conditional transfer of control* in a program. In other words, the execution of the program branches in many directions. This can be very problematic for optimizing code, because these branches are very expensive.

In contrast, the `cmov` instruction implements a *conditional transfer of data*. In other words, both the `then`-statement` and `else`-statement` of the conditional are executed, and the data is placed in the appropriate register based on the result of the condition.

The use of C’s **ternary expression** often results in the compiler generating a `cmov` instruction in place of jumps. For the standard if-then-else statement, the ternary expression has the form:

```
result = (condition) ? then_statement : else_statement;
```

Let’s use this format to rewrite the `getSmallest` function as a ternary expression. Keep in mind that this new version of the function behaves exactly as the original `getSmallest` function:

```c
int getSmallest_cmov(int x, int y) {
    return x > y ? y : x;
}
```

Although this may not seem like a big change, let’s look at the resulting assembly. Recall that the first and second parameters (`x` and `y`) are stored at stack addresses `%ebp+0x8` and `%ebp+0xc`, respectively.

```
0x08048441 <+0>:   push   %ebp              #save ebp
0x08048442 <+1>:   mov    %esp,%ebp         #update ebp
0x08048444 <+3>:   mov    0xc(%ebp),%eax    #copy y to %eax
0x08048447 <+6>:   cmp    %eax,0x8(%ebp)    #compare x with y
0x0804844a <+9>:   cmovle 0x8(%ebp),%eax    #if (x <= y) copy x to %eax
0x0804844e <+13>:  pop    %ebp              #restore %ebp
0x0804844f <+14>:  ret                      #return %eax
```

This assembly code has no jumps. After the comparison of `x` and `y`, `x` moves into the return register only if `x` is less than or equal to `y`. Like the jump instructions, the suffix of the `cmov` instructions indicates the condition on which the conditional move occurs. [Table 3](#CmovInstr32) lists the set of conditional move instructions.

| Signed | Unsigned | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cmove` (`cmovz`) |  | move if equal (==) |
| `cmovne` (`cmovnz`) |  | move if not equal (!=) |
| `cmovs` |  | move if negative |
| `cmovns` |  | move if non-negative |
| `cmovg` (`cmovnle`) | `cmova` (`cmovnbe`) | move if greater (>) |
| `cmovge` (`cmovnl`) | `cmovae` (`cmovnb`) | move if greater than or equal (>=) |
| `cmovl` (`cmovnge`) | `cmovb` (`cmovnae`) | move if less (<) |
| `cmovle` (`cmovng`) | `cmovbe` (`cmovna`) | move if less than or equal (<=) |

The compiler is very cautious about converting jump instructions into `cmov` instructions, especially in cases where side effects and pointer values are involved. [Table 4](#incrementX32) shows two equivalent ways of writing a function, `incrementX`:

**Table 4. Two functions that attempt to increment the value of integer `x`.**

**C code**

```c
int incrementX(int * x) {
    if (x != NULL) { //if x is not NULL
        return (*x)++; //increment x
    }
    else { //if x is NULL
        return 1; //return 1
    }
}
```

**C ternary form**

```c
int incrementX2(int * x){
    return x ? (*x)++ : 1;
}
```

Each function takes a pointer to an integer as input and checks whether it is `NULL`. If `x` is not `NULL`, the function increments and returns the dereferenced value of `x`. Otherwise, the function returns the value 1.

It is tempting to think that `incrementX2` uses a `cmov` instruction because it uses a ternary expression. However, both functions yield the exact same assembly code:

```
0x80484cf <+0>:   push   %ebp
0x80484d0 <+1>:   mov    %esp,%ebp
0x80484d2 <+3>:   cmpl   $0x0,0x8(%ebp)
0x80484d6 <+7>:   je     0x80484e7 <incrementX2+24>
0x80484d8 <+9>:   mov    0x8(%ebp),%eax
0x80484db <+12>:  mov    (%eax),%eax
0x80484dd <+14>:  lea    0x1(%eax),%ecx
0x80484e0 <+17>:  mov    0x8(%ebp),%edx
0x80484e3 <+20>:  mov    %ecx,(%edx)
0x80484e5 <+22>:  jmp    0x80484ec <incrementX2+29>
0x80484e7 <+24>:  mov    $0x1,%eax
0x80484ec <+29>:  pop    %ebp
0x80484ed <+30>:  ret
```

Recall that the `cmov` instruction *executes both branches of the conditional*. In other words, `x` gets dereferenced no matter what. Consider the case where `x` is a null pointer. Recall that dereferencing a null pointer leads to a null pointer exception in the code, causing a segmentation fault. To prevent any chance of this happening, the compiler takes the safe road and uses jumps.
