title: "8.10. Buffer Overflows"
lang: en
---

The C language does not perform automatic array bounds checking. Accessing memory outside of the bounds of an array is problematic and often results in errors such as segmentation faults. However, a clever attacker can inject malicious code that intentionally overruns the boundary of an array (also known as a **buffer**) to force the program to execute in an unintended manner. In the worst cases, the attacker can run code that allows them to gain **root privilege**, or OS-level access to the computer system. A piece of software that takes advantage of the existence of a known buffer overrun error in a program is known as a **buffer overflow exploit**.

In this section, we use GDB and assembly language to fully characterize the mechanics of a buffer overflow exploit. Prior to reading this chapter we encourage you to explore the chapter discussing [GDB for inspecting assembly code](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C3-C_debug/gdb_assembly.html#_debugging_assembly_code).

### [](#_famous_examples_of_buffer_overflow)8.10.1. Famous Examples of Buffer Overflow

Buffer overflow exploits emerged in the 1980s and remained a chief scourge of the computing industry through the early parts of the 2000s. While many modern operating systems have protections against the simplest buffer overflow attacks, careless programming errors can still leave modern programs wide open to attack. Buffer overflow exploits have recently been discovered in Skype1, Android2, Google Chrome3, and others.

Here are some notable historic examples of buffer overflow exploits.

The Morris Worm

The Morris Worm4 was released in 1988 on ARPANet from MIT (to hide that it was written by a student at Cornell) and exploited a buffer overrun vulnerability that existed in the Unix finger daemon (`fingerd`). In Linux and other Unix-like systems, a **daemon** is a type of process that continuously executes in the background, usually performing clean-up and monitoring tasks. The `fingerd` daemon returns a user-friendly report on a computer or person. Most crucially, the worm had a replication mechanism that caused it to be sent to the same computer multiple times, bogging down the system to an unusable state. Although the author claimed that the worm was meant as a harmless intellectual exercise, the replication mechanism enabled the worm to spread easily and made it difficult to remove. In future years, other worms would employ buffer overflow exploits to gain unauthorized access into systems. Notable examples include Code Red (2001), MS-SQLSlammer (2003), and W32/Blaster (2003).

AOL Chat Wars

David Auerbach5, a former Microsoft engineer, detailed his experience with a buffer overflow during his efforts to integrate Microsoft’s Messenger Service (MMS) with AOL Instant Messenger in the late 1990s. Back then, AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) was *the* service to use if you wanted to instant message (or IM) friends and family. Microsoft tried to gain a foothold in this market by designing a feature in MMS that enabled MMS users to talk to their AIM "buddies." Displeased, AOL patched their servers so that MMS could no longer connect to them. Microsoft engineers figured out a way for MMS clients to mimic the messages sent by AIM clients to AOL servers, making it difficult for AOL to distinguish between messages received by MMS and AIM. AOL responded by changing the way AIM sent messages, and MMS engineers duly changed their client’s messages to once again match AIM’s. This "chat war" continued until AOL started using a buffer overflow error *in their own client* to verify that sent messages came from AIM clients. Since MMS clients did not have the same vulnerability, the chat wars ended, with AOL as the victor.

### [](#_a_first_look_the_guessing_game)8.10.2. A First Look: The Guessing Game

To help you understand the mechanism of the buffer overflow attack, we provide a 32-bit executable of a simple program that enables the user to play a guessing game with the program. Download the `secret` executable at [this link](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C8-IA32/_attachments/secret.tar.gz) and extract it using the `tar` command:

```bash
$ tar -xzvf secret.tar.gz
```

Below, we provide a copy of `main.c` ([main.c](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C8-IA32/_attachments/main.c)), the main file associated with the executable:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "other.h" //contains secret function definitions

/*prints out the You Win! message*/
void endGame(void) {
    printf("You win!\n");
    exit(0);
}

/*main function of the game*/
int main(void) {

    int guess, secret, len;
    char buf[12]; //buffer (12 bytes long)

    printf("Enter secret number:\n");
    scanf("%s", buf); //read guess from user input
    guess = atoi(buf); //convert to an integer

    secret = getSecretCode(); //call the getSecretCode() function

    //check to see if guess is correct
    if (guess == secret) {
        printf("You got it right!\n");
    }
    else {
        printf("You are so wrong!\n");
        return 1; //if incorrect, exit
    }

    printf("Enter the secret string to win:\n");
    scanf("%s", buf); //get secret string from user input

    guess = calculateValue(buf, strlen(buf)); //call calculateValue function

    //check to see if guess is correct
    if (guess != secret){
        printf("You lose!\n");
        return 2; //if guess is wrong, exit
    }

    /*if both the secret string and number are correct
    call endGame()*/
    endGame();

    return 0;
}
```

This game prompts the user to enter first a secret number and then a secret string to win the guessing game. The header file `other.h` contains the definition of the `getSecretCode` and `calculateValue` functions, but it is unavailable to us. How then can a user beat the program? Brute forcing the solution will take too long. One strategy is to analyze the `secret` executable in GDB and step through the assembly to reveal the secret number and string. The process of examining assembly code to reveal knowledge of how it works is commonly referred to as **reverse engineering**. Readers comfortable enough with GDB and reading assembly should be able to use GDB to reverse engineer the secret number and the secret string.

However, there is a different, sneakier way to win.

### [](#_taking_a_closer_look_under_the_c)8.10.3. Taking a Closer Look (Under the C)

The program contains a potential buffer overrun vulnerability at the first call to `scanf`. To understand what is going on, let’s inspect the assembly code of the `main` function using GDB. Let’s also place a breakpoint at address 0x0804859f, which is the address of the instruction immediately before the call to `scanf` (placing the breakpoint at the address of `scanf` causes program execution to halt *inside* the call to `scanf`, not in `main`).

```
   0x08048582 <+0>:     push   %ebp
   0x08048583 <+1>:     mov    %esp,%ebp
   0x08048588 <+6>:     sub    $0x38,%esp
   0x0804858b <+9>:     movl   $0x8048707,(%esp)
   0x08048592 <+16>:    call   0x8048390 <printf@plt>
   0x08048597 <+21>:    lea    0x1c(%esp),%eax
   0x0804859b <+25>:    mov    %eax,0x4(%esp)
=> 0x0804859f <+29>:    movl   $0x804871c,(%esp)
   0x080485a6 <+36>:    call   0x80483e0 <scanf@plt>
```

[Figure 1](#beforescan32) depicts the stack immediately before the call to `scanf`.

![before](/images/dive-into-systems/c8-ia32-0-beforeScanf.webp) Figure 1. The call stack immediately before the call to scanf

Prior to the call to `scanf`, the arguments for `scanf` are preloaded onto the stack, with the first argument at the top of the stack, and the second argument one address below. The `lea` instruction at location `` creates the reference for array `buf`.

Now, suppose that the user enters `12345678` at the prompt. [[afterScanf]](#afterScanf) illustrates what the stack looks like immediately after the call to `scanf` completes.

![after](/images/dive-into-systems/c8-ia32-1-afterScanf.webp) Figure 2. The call stack immediately after the call to scanf with input 12345678

Recall that the hex values for the ASCII encodings of the digits 0 to 9 are 0x30 to 0x39, and that each stack memory location is four bytes long. The frame pointer is 56 bytes away from the stack pointer. Readers tracing along can confirm the value of `%ebp` by using GDB to print its value (`p $ebp`). In the example shown, the value of `%ebp` is 0xffffd428. The following command allows the reader to inspect the 64 bytes (in hex) below register `%esp`:

```
(gdb) x /64bx $esp
```

This GDB command yields output that looks similar to the following:

```
0xffffd3f0:     0x1c    0x87    0x04    0x08    0x0c    0xd4    0xff    0xff
0xffffd3f8:     0x00    0xa0    0x04    0x08    0xb2    0x86    0x04    0x08
0xffffd400:     0x01    0x00    0x00    0x00    0xc4    0xd4    0xff    0xff
0xffffd408:     0xcc    0xd4    0xff    0xff    0x31    0x32    0x33    0x34
0xffffd410:     0x35    0x36    0x37    0x38    0x00    0x80    0x00    0x00
0xffffd418:     0x6b    0x86    0x04    0x08    0x00    0x80    0xfb    0xf7
0xffffd420:     0x60    0x86    0x04    0x08    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00
0xffffd428:     0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x43    0x5a    0xe1    0xf7
```

Each line represents two 32-bit words. So, the first line represents the words at addresses 0xffffd3f0 and 0xffffd3f4. Looking at the top of the stack, we can see the memory address associated with the string `"%s"` (or 0x0804871c) followed by the address of `buf` (or 0xffffd40c). Note that the address for `buf` is simply represented as 0x40c in the figures in this section.

**Note — Multibyte values are stored in little-endian order**

> In the preceding assembly segment, the byte at address 0xfffffd3f0 is 0x1c, the byte at address 0xfffffd3f1 is 0x87, the byte at address 0xfffffd3f2 is 0x04, and the byte at address 0xfffffd3f3 is 0x08. However, the 32-bit *value* (which corresponds to the memory address of the string `"%s"`) at address 0xfffffd3f0 is in fact 0x0804871c. Remember that because x86 is a [little endian](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C4-Binary/byte_order.html#_integer_byte_order) system, the bytes for multibyte values such as addresses are stored in reverse order. Similarly, the bytes corresponding to the address of array `buf` (0xffffd40c) are stored in reverse order at address 0xfffffd3f4.

The bytes associated with address 0xffffd40c are located on the same line as those associated with address 0xffffd408, and are the second word on that line. Since the `buf` array is 12 bytes long, the elements associated with `buf` span the 12 bytes from address 0xffffd40c to 0xffffd417. Inspecting the bytes at those addresses yields:

```
0xffffd408:     0xcc    0xd4    0xff    0xff    0x31    0x32    0x33    0x34
0xffffd410:     0x35    0x36    0x37    0x38    0x00    0x80    0x00    0x00
```

At these locations, we can clearly see the hex representation of the input string 12345678. The null termination byte `\0` appears in the leftmost byte location at address 0xffffd414. Recall that scanf terminates all strings with a null byte.

Of course, 12345678 is not the secret number. Here is the output when we try to run `secret` with input string 12345678:

```bash
$ ./secret
$ ./secret
Enter secret number:
12345678
You are so wrong!
$ echo $?
1
```

The `echo $?` command prints out the return value of the last executed command in the shell. In this case, the program returned 1, because the secret number we entered is wrong. Recall that by convention, programs return 0 when there are no errors. Our goal going forward is to trick the program to exit with a return value of 0, indicating that we won the game.

### [](#_buffer_overflow_first_attempt)8.10.4. Buffer Overflow: First Attempt

Next, let’s try typing in the string `1234567890123456789012345678901234`:

```bash
$ ./secret
Enter secret number:
1234567890123456789012345678901234
You are so wrong!
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
$ echo $?
139
```

Interesting! Now the program crashes with a segmentation fault, with return code 139. [Figure 3](#afterScanf232) shows what the call stack for `main` looks like immediately after the call to `scanf` with this new input.

![after2](/images/dive-into-systems/c8-ia32-2-afterScanf2.webp) Figure 3. The call stack immediately after the call to scanf with input 1234567890123456789012345678901234

The input string is so long that it not only overwrote the value stored at address 0x428, but it spilled over into the return address below the stack frame for `main`. Recall that when a function returns, the program tries to resume execution at the address specified by the return address. In this example, the program tries to resume execution at address 0xf7003433 after exiting `main`, which does not exist. So the program crashes with a segmentation fault.

Rerunning the program in GDB (`input.txt` contains the input string above) reveals this devilry in action:

```bash
$ gdb secret
(gdb) break *0x804859b
(gdb) ni
(gdb) run < input.txt
(gdb) x /64bx $esp
0xffffd3f0:     0x1c    0x87    0x04    0x08    0x0c    0xd4    0xff    0xff
0xffffd3f8:     0x00    0xa0    0x04    0x08    0xb2    0x86    0x04    0x08
0xffffd400:     0x01    0x00    0x00    0x00    0xc4    0xd4    0xff    0xff
0xffffd408:     0xcc    0xd4    0xff    0xff    0x31    0x32    0x33    0x34
0xffffd410:     0x35    0x36    0x37    0x38    0x39    0x30    0x31    0x32
0xffffd418:     0x33    0x34    0x35    0x36    0x37    0x38    0x39    0x30
0xffffd420:     0x31    0x32    0x33    0x34    0x35    0x36    0x37    0x38
0xffffd428:     0x39    0x30    0x31    0x32    0x33    0x34    0x00    0xf7
```

Notice that our input string blew past the stated limits of the array `buf`, overwriting all the other values stored on the stack. In other words, our string created a buffer overrun and corrupted the call stack, causing the program to crash. This process is also known as **smashing the stack**.

### [](#_a_smarter_buffer_overflow_second_attempt)8.10.5. A Smarter Buffer Overflow: Second Attempt

Our first example smashed the stack by overwriting the `%ebp` register and return address with junk, causing the program to crash. An attacker whose goal is to simply crash a program would be satisfied at this point. However, our goal is to trick the guessing game to return 0, indicating that we won the game. We accomplish this by filling the call stack with data more meaningful than junk values. For example, we could overwrite the stack so that the return address is replaced with the address of `endGame`. Then, when the program attempts to return from `main`, it will instead execute `endGame` rather than crashing with a segmentation fault.

To find out the address of `endGame`, let’s inspect `secret` again in GDB:

```bash
$ gdb secret
(gdb) disas endGame
Dump of assembler code for function endGame:
   0x08048564 <+0>:     push   %ebp
   0x08048565 <+1>:     mov    %esp,%ebp
   0x08048567 <+3>:     sub    $0x18,%esp
   0x0804856a <+6>:     movl   $0x80486fe,(%esp)
   0x08048571 <+13>:    call   0x8048390 <puts@plt>
   0x08048576 <+18>:    movl   $0x0,(%esp)
   0x0804857d <+25>:    call   0x80483b0 <exit@plt>
End of assembler dump.
```

Observe that `endGame` starts at address 0x08048564. [Figure 4](#finalExploit32) illustrates a sample exploit that forces `secret` to run the `endGame` function.

![exploit](/images/dive-into-systems/c8-ia32-3-finalExploit.webp) Figure 4. A sample string that can force secret to execute the endGame function

Again, since x86 is a [little endian](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C4-Binary/byte_order.html#_integer_byte_order) system in which the stack grows toward lower addresses, the bytes in the return address appear to be in reverse order.

The following program illustrates how an attacker could construct the preceding exploit:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

char ebuff[]=
"\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x30" /*first 10 bytes of junk*/
"\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x30" /*next 10 bytes of junk*/
"\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x30" /*following 10 bytes of junk*/
"\x31\x32" /*last 2 bytes of junk*/
"\x64\x85\x04\x08" /*address of endGame (little endian)*/
;

int main(void) {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < sizeof(ebuff); i++) { /*print each character*/
        printf("%c", ebuff[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The `\x` before each number indicates that the number is formatted as the hexadecimal representation of a character. After defining `ebuff[]`, the `main` function simply prints it out, character by character. To get the associated byte string, compile and run this program as follows:

```bash
$ gcc -o genEx genEx.c
$ ./genEx > exploit
```

To use the file `exploit` as input to `scanf` it suffices to run `secret` with `exploit` as follows:

```bash
$ ./secret < exploit
Enter secret number:
You are so wrong!
You win!
```

The program prints out "You are so wrong!" because the string contained in `exploit` is *not* the secret number. However, the program also prints out the string "You win!" Recall, though, that our goal is to trick the program to return 0. In a larger system, where the notion of "success" is tracked by an external program, it is often most important what a program returns, not what it prints out.

Checking the return value yields:

```bash
$ echo $?
0
```

Our exploit works! We won the game!

### [](#_protecting_against_buffer_overflow)8.10.6. Protecting Against Buffer Overflow

The example we showed changed the control flow of the `secret` executable, forcing it to return a zero value associated with success. However, an exploit like this could do some real damage. Furthermore, some older computer systems *executed* bytes from stack memory. If an attacker placed bytes associated with assembly instructions on the call stack, the CPU would interpret the bytes as *real* instructions, enabling the attacker to force the CPU to execute *any arbitrary code of their choosing*. Fortunately, there are strategies that modern computer systems employ to make it more difficult for attackers to run buffer overflow exploits:

- **Stack Randomization**: The OS allocates the starting address of the stack at a random location in stack memory, causing the position/size of the call stack to vary from one run of a program to another. Multiple machines running the same code would have different stack addresses. Modern Linux systems use stack randomization as a standard practice. However, a determined attacker can brute force the attack, by attempting to repeat attacks with different addresses. A common trick is to use a **NOP sled** (or slide), i.e., a large number of `nop` instructions, before the actual exploit code. Executing the `nop` instruction (`0x90`) has no effect, other than causing the program counter to increment to the next instruction. As long as the attacker can get the CPU to execute somewhere in the NOP sled, the NOP sled will eventually lead to the exploit code that follows it. Aleph One’s writeup, *Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit*6 details the mechanism of this type of attack.
- **Stack corruption detection**: Another line of defense is to try to detect when the stack is corrupted. Recent versions of GCC use a stack protector known as a **canary** that acts as a guard between the buffer and the other elements of the stack. A canary is a value stored in a nonwriteable section of memory that can be compared to a value put on the stack. If the canary "dies" during a program’s execution, the program knows that it is under attack and aborts with an error message. A clever attacker can, however, replace the canary to prevent the program from detecting stack corruption.
- **Limiting executable regions**: In this line of defense, executable code is restricted to only particular regions of memory. In other words, the call stack is no longer executable. However, even this defense can be defeated. In an attack utilizing **return-oriented programming** (ROP), an attacker can "cherry-pick" instructions in executable regions and jump from instruction to instruction to build an exploit. There are some famous examples of this online, especially in video games7.

However, the best line of defense is always the programmer. To prevent buffer overflow attacks on your programs, use C functions with **length specifiers** whenever possible and add code that performs array bounds checking. It is crucial that any defined arrays match the chosen length specifiers. [Table 1](#specifiers32) lists some common "bad" C functions that are vulnerable to buffer overflow and the corresponding "good" function to use (assume that `buf` is allocated 12 bytes).

| Instead of: | Use: |
| --- | --- |
| `gets(buf)` | `fgets(buf, 12, stdin)` |
| `scanf("%s", buf)` | `scanf("%12s", buf)` |
| `strcpy(buf2, buf)` | `strncpy(buf2, buf, 12)` |
| `strcat(buf2, buf)` | `strncat(buf2, buf, 12)` |
| `sprintf(buf, "%d", num)` | `snprintf(buf, 12, "%d", num)` |

The `secret2` binary ([secret2.tar.gz](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C8-IA32/_attachments/secret2.tar.gz)) no longer has the buffer overflow vulnerability. Here’s the `main` function of this new binary ([main2.c](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C8-IA32/_attachments/main2.c)):

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "other.h" //contain secret function definitions

/*prints out the You Win! message*/
void endGame(void) {
    printf("You win!\n");
    exit(0);
}

/*main function of the game*/
int main(void) {
    int guess, secret, len;
    char buf[12]; //buffer (12 bytes long)

    printf("Enter secret number:\n");
    scanf("%12s", buf); //read guess from user input (fixed!)
    guess = atoi(buf); //convert to an integer

    secret=getSecretCode(); //call the getSecretCode function

    //check to see if guess is correct
    if (guess == secret) {
        printf("You got it right!\n");
    }
    else {
        printf("You are so wrong!\n");
        return 1; //if incorrect, exit
    }

    printf("Enter the secret string to win:\n");
    scanf("%12s", buf); //get secret string from user input (fixed!)

    guess = calculateValue(buf, strlen(buf)); //call calculateValue function

    //check to see if guess is correct
    if (guess != secret) {
        printf("You lose!\n");
        return 2; //if guess is wrong, exit
    }

    /*if both the secret string and number are correct
    call endGame()*/
    endGame();

    return 0;
}
```

Notice that we added a length specifier to all calls of `scanf`, causing the `scanf` function to stop reading from input after the first 12 bytes are read. The exploit string no longer breaks the program:

```bash
$ ./secret2 < exploit
Enter secret number:
You are so wrong!
$ echo $?
1
```

Of course, any reader with basic reverse-engineering skills can still win the guessing game by analyzing the assembly code. If you haven’t tried to beat the program yet with reverse engineering, we encourage you to do so now.
